<h2 id="PREFACE"><i>PREFACE.</i></h2>

<p>At the suggestion of a few friends, the
author undertook this work. His intention
at first was to confine it solely to Capt. Barclay’s
performances. But on farther consideration,
he thought that the <i>feats</i> of other
pedestrians might be introduced, and the
plan enlarged, so as to embrace a treatise
conveying information or amusement to
readers in general, as well as to sporting
gentlemen.</p>

<p>He has therefore treated of objects connected
with the physical powers of man,
with the view of drawing the attention of
the public to the best means of strengthening
and augmenting the capacities of the
body. The subject he deems important,
especially at a time when the physical energies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
of many of our countrymen are frequently
brought into action by the conflicts
of war.</p>

<p>The republics of Greece prepared their
youth for the duty of the field by their
gymnastic institutions; and the Romans
were exercised by long marches, running,
leaping, and throwing the javelin. But
with the soldiers of Britain, a different system
prevails. While stationed at home,
they are allowed to waste their time in
“indolent repose,” and prevented from taking
even that degree of exercise which is requisite
to health, lest they should exhaust
the most trifling of their necessaries, before
the return of the usual period of supply.
All the advantages they might derive from
a course of training, are thus sacrificed to an
ill-judged economy, and to the vain show
of a parade or field day.</p>

<p>The author has considered <i>Exercise</i> in a
military point of view, and he thinks he
cannot too strongly urge the necessity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
adopting such measures for training our
troops preparatory to actual service as would
fit them for undergoing the hardships of the
campaign.</p>

<p>He therefore trusts that this work may
deserve the perusal of military men&mdash;no
class in the community having so much occasion
to prepare themselves to bear bodily
fatigue, as those who are engaged in the
business of war.&mdash;And, if it be fully explained,
as the author hopes it is, by what expedients
men may be enabled to undergo more
than ordinary exertion, the subject certainly
merits the consideration of the defenders of
their country.</p>

<p>But as exercise conduces so much to the
strength and soundness of both body and
mind, the subjects treated in this volume,
may be deemed, he presumes, of sufficient
moment to deserve the attention of all
classes.</p>

<p>The different pedestrian matches which
are recorded, may serve to illustrate general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
principles, as they exhibit the power of the
human frame; and hence conclusions of
extensive utility may be deduced. But to
<i>Sporting Gentlemen</i> this work is particularly
interesting, as they will find, concisely related,
the performances of the most celebrated
pedestrians of the present age. And
from what has been already done, they may
form some opinion of what it is possible for
others to accomplish; and thus regulate
their <i>bets</i> according to the different circumstances
of the cases under their review.</p>

<p>The author acknowledges his obligations
to several gentlemen of the highest respectability,
for their encouragement and patronage.
To Capt. Barclay, in particular, he
is much indebted, for having not only furnished
the chapter on training, but also for
having taken the trouble to revise the greater
part of the work.</p>

<h1>PEDESTRIANISM.</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">ON THE GYMNASTIC EXERCISES OF THE ANCIENTS.</span></h2>

<p>Gymnastic exercises were held in the
highest repute by the most illustrious nations
of antiquity. They mingled with the sacred
and political institutions of their governments,
and produced consequences affecting the physical
and moral character of the people.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Games</span> interested all Greece; and the
period of their celebration was that of peace
and security. The different republics, with
their dependent colonies in the isles, in Asia,
and Africa, furnished candidates emulous to
gain the distinguished honors. Hostile states,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
then uniting in bonds of friendship, interchanged
those favourable impressions which
tend to humanize the rough nature of man;
and that asperity of temper, or animosity of
heart, so characteristic of rude nations, was
thus softened or lulled.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sacred Games</span> of the Greeks, were
composed of the exhibitions of the <span class="smcap">Stadium</span>
and <span class="smcap">Hippodrome</span>; and the charms of poetry
and music were added, to gratify the more
refined taste of the lovers of these exquisite
arts. Philosophers, poets, historians, orators,
and every description of people, assembled to
witness the exertions of the combatants, and
to enjoy the varied pleasures of the festival.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Olympic</span> games claimed precedency
over all others; and to <span class="smcap">Iphitus</span>, king of
<span class="smcap">Elis</span>, they owe their revival&mdash;for their origin
is lost in the obscurity of remote ages. The
Eleans obtained the direction and management,
by the united consent of Greece; and
their territory, on this account, was deemed
inviolable. They founded their prosperity
on the cultivation of peace; and, on sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
ground, raised a temple dedicated to Jupiter,
which inclosed them within the pale of its
protecting influence.</p>

<p>“The temple,” (says Strabo, lib. viii.) “stands
in the Pisæan division, little less than three
hundred stadia distant from <span class="smcap">Elis</span>. Before
it is a grove of wild olives, within which
lies the <span class="smcap">Olympic</span> stadium.” The temple
was magnificent. It was built of beautiful
marble, in the Doric order, and surrounded
by a colonade<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. It was ornamented by the
finest productions of art&mdash;the genius of the
sculptor and painter having adorned the sacred
edifice<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. But the <span class="smcap">Stadium</span> was no more
than a terrace of earth, the area of which was
six hundred and thirty-eight feet in length.
On the one side was erected the seat of the
<span class="smcap">Hellanodics</span>, or judges; and on the other,
an altar of white marble, upon which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
priestess of <span class="smcap">Ceres</span>, and her virgins, had the
privilege of viewing the games. At the farther
extremity was the barrier, where those
who contended in the <span class="smcapuc">SIMPLE FOOT-RACE</span> began
their course; and there also was situated
the tomb of <span class="smcap">Endymion</span><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Stadium</span> was appropriated to the exhibition
of those games denominated <span class="smcap">Gymnastic</span>;
and they consisted of five different
exercises, viz.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1st, <span class="smcap">Running</span>, or <span class="smcap">Foot-racing</span>.</p>

<p>2d, <span class="smcap">Leaping</span>.</p>

<p>3d, <span class="smcap">Wrestling</span>.</p>

<p>4th, <span class="smcap">Throwing the Discus</span>; and,</p>

<p>5th, <span class="smcap">Boxing</span>, or <span class="smcap">Pancratia</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>The <span class="smcapuc">FOOT-RACE</span> was the most ancient, and
claimed a pre-eminence over the other sports;
the Olympiads being distinguished by the
name of the victor who obtained the prize in
this game.&mdash;But as our subject is particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
connected with this branch of the ancient
gymnastics, we shall treat it more fully in the
sequel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leaping</span> consisted in projecting the body
by a sudden spring, in which the competitors
endeavoured to surpass each other in the
length of their leap. Their bodies were
poised and impelled forwards by weights of
lead suspended in their hands; and it is said,
that <span class="smcap">Phaulus</span> of Cretona acquired such proficiency
in this exercise as to leap fifty-two
feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wrestling.</span>&mdash;This art required both
strength and agility. The wrestlers were
matched by lot; and the prize belonged to
him who had thrice thrown his adversary on
the ground. They rubbed their bodies with
oil to elude the grasp, and to prevent too
profuse perspiration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Throwing the Discus.</span>&mdash;This sport consisted
in throwing a globular mass of iron,
brass, or stone, under the hand, in the manner
of the English quoit. It tried the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
strength of the arms; and the length of the
cast decided the claims of the competitors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boxing</span>, or the <span class="smcap">Pancratia</span>.&mdash;This combat
was performed either by the naked fist, or
with the addition of the <span class="smcap">Cæstus</span>, which was
made of straps of leather, lined with metal.
Boxing was one of the most dangerous of
the gymnastic contests, and frequently terminated
in maiming, or death.</p>

<p>Judges called <span class="smcap">Hellanodics</span> were appointed
to preside at the Olympic festival; and their
office conveyed great authority. They inflicted
corporal punishments and pecuniary
penalties on those who infringed the Olympic
laws: and that vast assembly of combatants
and spectators, which was composed of men
of every rank and degree, was thus kept in
order and regularity. For ten centuries, religion
and custom consecrated their powerful
influence to the maintenance of the sacred
games&mdash;the period of their revival by Iphitus,
being seven hundred and seventy-six years
before the birth of Christ. The duration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
this institution shews its perfect organization,
and that, while it comprized so many different
states, its laws were administered with justice
and impartiality.</p>

<p>The games were celebrated every fifth
year; and the candidates for the Olympic
crown, termed <span class="smcap">Athletæ</span>, were obliged, previously,
to enter their names, that they might
be known to the Hellanodics, and their pretensions
to the honor of competition investigated.
Ten months of preparatory training
were requisite; of which one was devoted to
exercise in the stadium in the presence of the
judges, in order to qualify the competitor for
the arduous trial; and <span class="smcapuc">FREE</span> citizens only,
whose characters were irreproachable, and
who, in other respects, had complied with the
rules of the institution, were permitted to
contend. So important was the prize of victory,
that none but men of spotless reputation
were allowed to enter the lists, which were
carefully guarded against the intrusion of unworthy
or improper persons.</p>

<p>The games lasted five days, and commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
with the <span class="smcapuc">FOOT-RACE</span>, which was the
first in order, and the highest in estimation
of all the gymnastic exercises.</p>

<p>At first, the race, as instituted by Iphitus,
was <span class="smcapuc">SIMPLE</span>. It consisted of running once
from the barrier to the goal, or from the one
extremity of the stadium to the other. But
in the fourteenth Olympiad, the <span class="smcap">Diaulus</span> was
introduced, which, as the word implies, was
double the former distance. The runners in
this race turned round the goal, and finished
their course at the barrier, whence they had
started. In the next Olympiad, the <span class="smcap">Dolichus</span>,
or <span class="smcapuc">LONG COURSE</span>, was added, which consisted
of six, twelve, or twenty-four stadia, or
in doubling the goal three, six, or twelve
times.</p>

<p>In the simple foot-race, fleetness or agility
only was required; but in the long course,
strength of body, and command of <span class="smcapuc">WIND</span>, were
indispensable to enable the candidate to gain
the prize. Strength and agility are seldom
united in the same person; yet there are
some modern examples of the union of both;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and, in antiquity, <span class="smcap">Leonidas</span> of <span class="smcap">Rhodes</span> obtained
the triple crown, in four Olympiads,
and was thus distinguished in the list of conquerors
by twelve victories<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>The competitors in the gymnastic exercises
contended naked; but in the sixty-fifth Olympiad,
the race of <span class="smcapuc">ARMED MEN</span> was introduced,
as particularly applicable to the duties of
war: and, according to Pausanias, lib. v.
twenty-five brass bucklers were kept in a
temple at Olympia for the purpose of equipping
the candidates, who wore also helmets
and bucklers. <span class="smcap">Damaretus</span> gained the first
victory in this race, which in no respect differed
from the stadium, or simple foot-race,
but that the Athletæ were covered with armour.</p>

<p>While the runners waited the sound of the
trumpet as the signal to start, they exercised
themselves by various feats of agility, and
short experimental excursions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“They try, they rouse their speed with various arts,</div>
<div class="verse">“Their languid limbs they prompt to act their parts,</div>
<div class="verse">“And with bent hams, amid the practis’d crowd,</div>
<div class="verse">“They sit; now strain their lungs, and shout aloud;</div>
<div class="verse">“Now a short flight, with fiery steps they trace,</div>
<div class="verse">“And with a sudden stop abridge the mimic race.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the signal was given, the racers ran
with amazing rapidity. They “seemed on
feathered feet to fly,” and the first who arrived
at the goal was declared the victor.</p>

<p>So highly were gymnastics estimated in
Greece, that the most liberal rewards, and
the most flattering honors, were bestowed
on the victors, whose glory shed a lustre
around their friends, their parents, and their
country.</p>

<p>The Olympic crown was composed of the
branches of the wild olive; but the pine, the
parsley, and the laurel, were the symbols appropriated
to the several solemnities of the
sacred games at the Isthmus, Nemea, and
Delphi. This reward, however, was only a
pledge of the many honors, immunities, and
privileges, consequent of the glory of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
crowned. To excite the emulation of the
competitors, these crowns were laid on a tripod
which was placed in the middle of the
stadium, where also were exposed branches
of <span class="smcapuc">PALM</span>, which the conquerors received at
the same time, to carry in their hands, as
emblems of their invincible vigour of body
and mind<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>The ceremony of investing the victors with
this distinguished prize, was attended with
great solemnity. The conquerors were called
by proclamation to the tribunal of the
Hellanodics, where the <span class="smcap">Herald</span> placed a
crown of olive upon the head of each of
them, and gave into his hand a branch of the
palm. Thus adorned with the trophies of
victory, they were led along the stadium
preceded by trumpets; and the herald proclaimed
with a loud voice, their own names,
and those of their fathers, and country; and
specified the particular exercise in which
each of them had gained the victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the Hellanodics could bestow no
other reward than the <span class="smcap">Olive Chaplet</span>, which
was merely a symbol, yet the shouts of applause
from the spectators, and the congratulations
of relatives, friends, and assembled
countrymen, formed a meed that gratified the
ambition of the conquerors. Sacrifices were
made in honor of the victors, and entertainments
were given, in which they presided, or
were otherwise eminently distinguished. In
the <span class="smcap">Prytaneum</span>, or town-hall of Olympia, a
banqueting-room was set apart for the special
purpose of entertaining them; and odes composed
for the occasion were sung by a <span class="smcap">Chorus</span>,
accompanied with instrumental music<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>There can be nothing more gratifying to
laudable ambition, than the idea that great
actions shall be handed down to posterity.
To perpetuate, therefore, the glory of these
victories, the names of the conquerors were
recorded in a public register, which specified
the exercise in which each had excelled: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the privilege of erecting their statues in the
<span class="smcap">Sacred Grove of Jupiter</span>, was the last and
highest honor which the Hellanodics could
grant to the Olympic victors.</p>

<p>But upon arriving in their native cities, the
conquerors were far more distinguished than
at Olympia; and more substantial rewards
were conferred upon them. They enjoyed
the honor of a triumphal entry; and temples
and altars, dedicated to them, were erected at
the public expense. They were thus immortalized
by what was deemed the perfection of
glory. “To conquer at Olympia,” says
Cicero, “was greater and more glorious
than to receive the honors of a Roman
triumph.”</p>

<p>The importance which the Greeks attached
to the Olympic games may be deduced from
the care with which they instructed their
youth in the gymnastic exercises. There was
scarcely a town of any consideration in Greece,
or in her colonies settled along the coasts of
Asia and Africa&mdash;in the Ionian and Ægean
islands&mdash;in Sicily and in Italy, in which there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
was not a <span class="smcap">Gymnasium</span>, or school of exercise,
maintained at the public expense.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Gymnasia</span> were spacious buildings, of
a square or oblong form, surrounded on the
outside with piazzas, and containing in the
inside, a large area where the exercises were
performed. Places for training in bad weather&mdash;porticoes,
baths, chambers for oil and sand,
with groves of trees, and seats, or benches, encompassed
the stadium. The internal structure
of these edifices was adapted to the convenience
of those who frequented them, either
for exercise or for pleasure; and they were
the resort of rhetoricians, philosophers, and
men of learning, who here read their lectures,
held their disputations, and recited their several
productions<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>The moral and political influence of the
Olympic games was acknowledged by the
legislators of Greece; and accordingly, they
were encouraged and protected by laws so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
strict, that for more than ten centuries they
attracted the particular attention of the civilized
world; and, amidst the revolutions of
states and empires, they seemed to stand on
a basis of perpetual duration. To gain the
Olympic crown was the great object of solicitude,
as it reflected the highest honor, not
on the individual alone who obtained the
prize, but also on the country which gave
him birth. But to qualify the candidate for
the combat, a long course of training was
requisite; and in every city, the youth were
instructed in the different branches of the
gymnastic science, and regularly exercised
by proper masters.</p>

<p>The republics of Greece were warlike in
their constitution; and they were eager to
form the bodies, as well as the minds of their
youth. The importance of the athletic exercises
was apparent to those who understood
the nature of the human frame, which, from
experience, they knew could be strengthened
by the practice of the gymnasium, at the
same time that the mind was invigorated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
consequent health and soundness in the body.
We may therefore consider the sacred games
of Greece rather as a military institution, than
a religious festival; and that the worship of
the gods, although combined with the sports
of the <span class="smcap">Stadium</span> and <span class="smcap">Hippodrome</span>, was only a
secondary object, calculated to impress on the
minds of the people a higher idea of their
value and importance. In the ancient world,
as well as in modern times, religion has been
made a tool to promote state artifices; and
the legislators of Greece knew too well the
influence of superstition, to reject its powerful
aid in the construction of their political
establishments.</p>

<p>As a civil and military institution, the
sacred games were attended by the happiest
consequences. They presented a prize to the
emulous youth, accompanied by such honors
as powerfully stimulated their endeavours to
acquire that proficiency in the gymnastic
sports, which could only be obtained by frequent
practice in the schools of their respective
cities. The Athenians devoted nearly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
third part of the year to such amusements;
and from the number of Olympic victors
whose national designations are recorded by
ancient writers, we may suppose, that the
other states of Greece were no less zealous in
the exercises of the gymnasium<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>To prepare men for the business of war,
was the grand object of these institutions.&mdash;The
Greeks were divided into small independent
states, which were constantly embroiled
with one another; and their strength
was founded on the number and discipline of
the troops they could respectively bring into
the field. To increase the number of fighting
men, and to train them in the most effectual
manner, was, therefore, the principal
object of the different governments. By
learning and practising the gymnastic exercises,
their youth were inured to toil, and
rendered healthy, hardy, vigorous, and active.
They were prepared for all the duties of war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Neither the inclemency of the weather, nor
the scorching beams of the sun could affect
them, as their bodies by continual exercise
had become more robust, and less liable to be
injured, than the natural frame of ordinary
men.</p>

<p>The Grecian manner of fighting required
both strength and agility, as the long spear
of the “firm phalanx” could not be easily
wielded, and the occasionally rapid marches
of the Greek armies over a rugged country,
sufficiently evince the utility of active habits.
To the <span class="smcapuc">PRACTICE</span> of the gymnasia, the Greeks
owe all the glory they acquired in war; and
it was the opinion of Plato, “that every well
constituted republic ought, by offering prizes
to the conquerors, to encourage all such exercises
as tend to increase the strength and
agility of the body<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.”</p>

<p>The admirable symmetry of the Grecian
statues, establishes, beyond controversy, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
just proportions and great beauty of their prototypes;
and to the education of their youth,
we must ascribe the fine forms of the Greek
people, who, by avoiding idleness and dissipation,
and by mingling exercise with amusement,
created, as it were, an improved race of
men. In a moral point of view, then, the
gymnastics of the ancients were of the utmost
importance. They furnished occupation to
all those who were not engaged in laborious
employments, or in the service of the state;&mdash;who
were exempted from the drudgery of
business by their affluent condition; and, indeed,
to every man who had a vacant hour to
devote to amusement or exercise. The gymnasia
may be termed schools for morality, as
they contributed to diminish vice, and to increase
virtue: they served the double purpose
of strengthening the good, and weakening
the bad, propensities of human nature.</p>

<p>They who aimed at eminence in the gymnastic
exercises were compelled to observe
temperance and sobriety, which greatly promoted
the health and vigour of the body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Every thing enervating was forbidden; and
the pleasures of the table, or sensual indulgence
of any kind, rendered the Athletæ unfit
for the severe exercise of the gymnasia. <span class="smcap">Horace</span>
remarks, (Art. Poet. ver. 412,) that,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“A youth who hopes the Olympic prize to gain,</div>
<div class="verse">All arts must try, and ev’ry toil sustain;</div>
<div class="verse">Th’ extremes of heat and cold must often prove,</div>
<div class="verse"><i>And shun the weak’ning joys of wine and love</i>.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In a voluptuous climate, the propensity to
vicious indulgence is natural and powerful;
but among the Greeks, it was counteracted
by the firm organization which they acquired
by perpetual exercise; and the universality
of the games diffused among the whole people
the important advantages of the institution.</p>

<p>Corporeal excellence, however, was not the
only benefit which the Greeks derived from
the Athletic exercises. The powers of the
mind were also strengthened and augmented,
and that courage which depends on the nerves
was improved to the highest pitch. The undaunted
spirit of the Greeks appalled their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
enemies; and the most signal exploits in the
field of battle were performed by those who
had previously obtained the Olympic crown<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.
The love of glory is the greatest incentive to
splendid actions; and the <span class="smcap">Sacred Games</span> fostered
a passion that could easily be transferred
from the gymnasia to the contests in the field.
One Grecian could conquer ten Persians, for
his body was robust, and his mind was brave;
and <span class="smcap">Honor</span> was the sole reward which he
courted.</p>

<p>It is related by Herodotus, (lib. viii. c. 25.)
that when Xerxes invaded Greece, he found
the Grecians employed in celebrating the
Olympic festival, and that the prize which
they contended for, was no more than&mdash;<span class="smcapuc">A
CHAPLET OF WILD OLIVE</span>. <span class="smcap">Tigranes</span>, the son
of <span class="smcap">Artabanus</span>, exclaimed, “Alas, Mardonius!
against what kind of men have you
led us to fight! men who engage in a contest
with each other, not for gold and silver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
but only for a superiority of virtue and
glory!”</p>

<p>The physical, political, and moral influence
of the gymnastic exercises on the bodies and
minds of the Greeks, was thus evinced by
their superior beauty and strength&mdash;their
strict observance of the laws of their country&mdash;their
bravery in war&mdash;and by their temperance,
sobriety, and industry, in civil life.</p>

<p>Of all the Olympic games, the <span class="smcapuc">FOOT-RACE</span>,
as we have previously remarked, held the foremost
rank. Homer distinguishes Achilles by
the epithet “swift of foot;” and, whether as
conducive to health, useful in the affairs of
life, or important in the operations of war,
pedestrian exercises must be considered as of
the utmost consequence to mankind. The
human frame is peculiarly calculated for activity
and exertion; and it should be remembered,
that it is by <span class="smcap">Exercise</span> and <span class="smcap">Labour</span>
that man is enabled to preserve his health, increase
his strength, improve the faculties of
his mind, and procure his subsistence.</p>

<p>Among the ancient Greeks and Romans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
there were runners of great celebrity; and the
rapid marches of their armies on various emergencies,
shew how much they were habituated
to pedestrian exercises. Two thousand Lacedemonians
marched from Sparta to Attica in
three days&mdash;a distance of twelve hundred
stadia&mdash;to assist the Athenians at the battle
of Marathon. Phidippides ran seven hundred
and fifty stadia in the space of two days, which
was deemed a most extraordinary effort, until
Philonides, the runner of Alexander the Great,
accomplished twelve hundred stadia in one
day, from Sicyone to Ellis. In the reign of
Nero, a boy of nine years of age, ran seventy-five
thousand paces, between noon and night<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>Although the modern governments of Europe
have not hitherto afforded any patronage
to gymnastic exercises, yet pedestrianism has
been brought to great perfection by spirited
individuals, especially in Britain. Exploits
more extraordinary than any on the records<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of antiquity have been accomplished in this
country; and it shall be our duty in the next
and succeeding chapters, to give a particular
account of these astonishing performances.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">MODERN PEDESTRIANISM.</span></h2>

<p>Since the remote period of Greek and
Roman prosperity, nothing analagous to the
Olympic games has been exhibited in Europe,
if we except modern horse-racing, which bears
a faint resemblance; or, perhaps, the tournaments
of the middle ages, which presented a
nearer similitude.</p>

<p>Although the art of war be now different,
in some respects, from that which was practised
among the ancients, it is still not less
requisite in the present than in former times,
to strengthen the physical and intellectual
powers of the soldier. To endure the vicissitudes
of climates and seasons&mdash;to bear cold,
hunger, and thirst&mdash;to perform long marches
under the inclemency of the weather&mdash;and to
preserve his spirit unbroken amidst the tumult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of the battle, are the severe duties of his profession.
It is by <span class="smcap">Exercise</span> that the soldier is
gradually inured to the hardships of the field;
and the importance of preparatory training
was well known to the ancients, who accordingly
converted the amusements of the people
into a course of military discipline. The exercises
of the gymnasia prepared the youth for
the fatigues of the campaign, by strengthening
their bodies, and invigorating their minds;
and they accomplished those brilliant achievements
which stand unrivalled in the page of
history.</p>

<p>It is justly remarked by Dr. West<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, “that a
wise and prudent governor of a state may
dispose the people to such sports and diversions
as may render them more serviceable
to the public; and that, by impartially bestowing
a few <span class="smcapuc">HONORARY PRIZES</span> upon those
who should be found to excel in any <span class="smcapuc">CONTEST</span>
he shall think proper to appoint, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
may excite in the husbandman, the manufacturer,
and the mechanic, as well as in the
soldier and the sailor, and men of superior
orders and professions, such an emulation as
may tend to promote industry, encourage
trade, improve the knowledge and wisdom
of mankind, and consequently make his
country victorious in war, and, in peace,
opulent and happy.”</p>

<p>It is admitted, that the new levies in the
British army are diminished more by fatigue,
than by the sword of the enemy. Our regiments
are gradually wasted by sickness and
disease, for they are not fitted by a course of
preparatory training, to undergo those hardships
to which they are unavoidably exposed;
and the sudden transition from a life of ease
to that of great activity, too frequently proves
fatal to men of feeble bodies and weak constitutions.
Were the practice of the ancients
imitated, by the erection of schools for gymnastic
exercises, and our young soldiers subjected
to a process of training, the lives of
many of them would be saved to their country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and the efficient strength of our army greatly
augmented.</p>

<p>Mr. Edgeworth, while treating on military
education, says, “As to <span class="smcapuc">EXERCISE</span> and <span class="smcapuc">AMUSEMENTS</span>
for the pupils in a military academy,
they should all be calculated to promote and
sustain manly dispositions. The judicious
<span class="smcap">Sully</span> recommends, in the strongest manner,
to military youth, those sports and exercises
which form a graceful carriage, and give
strength to the limbs.”&mdash;‘I was,’ says he, ‘always
of the same opinion as Henry IV. concerning
these exercises. He often asserted,
that they were the most solid foundation,
not only of discipline, and other military
virtues, <i>but also of those noble sentiments, and
that elevation of mind which gives one nation
pre-eminence over another</i>.’</p>

<p>“A military school should have annual
competitions and prizes for foot-races, leaping,
wrestling, fencing, and firing at a target.
Though the prize need not be absolutely
wreaths of oak or parsley, yet whatever they
are, they should be more honorary than lucrative.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
The victors should be rewarded also
with the applauses of the public, the countenance
of the great, and sometimes, perhaps,
with the patronage of the government.”&mdash;“All
sports,” he farther observes, “without
exception, that promote strength and agility,
should be encouraged in our military
schools<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.”</p>

<p>But to every man, the proper exercise of the
body is an important object, as good health
and spirits constitute the greatest blessing of
nature, for our pleasures are derived from the
capability of enjoying them. Dr. Churchill
justly remarks<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, “that, in the formation of
our frames, and the very nature of our constitution,
it was the positive institution of Providence,
to create in us an absolute necessity
for exercise, in order to our well-being.” And
he farther says, that “by attention to exercise,
the tone and vigour of the moving powers
are wonderfully increased; the nervous energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and circulation of the blood are materially accelerated;
and this increased impetus of the
blood through the whole system produces an
effectual determination to the surface of the
skin; and free perspiration is the consequence.
By the same means, the body is disposed to
sleep; the appetite increased; the tone of the
stomach and digestive powers preserved; and
the blood is determined from the internal viscera,
which prevents as well as removes obstructions,
and powerfully obviates the tendency
to a plethoric fulness of the system.
By exercise, the spirits are enlivened, and the
body refreshed; or, as Hippocrates observes,
it gives strength to the body, and vigour to
the mind; and it is an irrefragable truth, that
where it is improperly neglected, the energy
and strength of the whole machine falls to
decay.”</p>

<p>To the authority of Dr. Churchill, may be
added that of the celebrated Dr. Willich, who,
in the Seventh Chapter of his Lectures on
Diet and Regimen, (p. 441-2,) observes, that
“motion, or bodily exercise, is necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the preservation of health, which is promoted,
while the bounds of moderation are not exceeded.
Too violent exercise, or a total want
of it, are attended with equal disadvantages.
Much also depends on the kind of motion,
and the various postures of the body.</p>

<p>“The essential advantages of exercise are
the following: Bodily strength is increased;
the circulation of the blood and all other fluids
promoted; the necessary secretions and excretions
are duly performed; the whole mass
of the blood is cleared and refined, so that it
cannot stagnate in the minutest capillary vessels;
and if any obstruction should begin to
take place, it will thus be effectually removed.</p>

<p>“That exercise is enjoined by Nature, we
may learn from the whole structure of the
human body; the number of muscles formed
for motion; and the mechanism in the circulation
of the blood itself. There are indeed
no healthier people than those who take strong
daily exercise. Man in a state of health is instinctively
excited to muscular exertion; and
children that are perfectly healthy, are constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
running about, and in almost uninterrupted
motion.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Pedestrianism</span> affords the best species of
exercise, and may be said to include much
that is valuable to mankind. Those distinguished
persons, therefore, who by their example,
have rendered this branch of the gymnastic
art <span class="smcapuc">FASHIONABLE</span> and <span class="smcapuc">GENERAL</span>, deserve
the highest praise. To Captain Barclay,
Captain Agar, Captain Acres, Lieutenant
Fairman, and many other gentlemen, this
country is greatly indebted for their improvement
of this art. It is only the thoughtless
and inconsiderate part of the community that
does not discover the benefits resulting from
the exploits of such celebrated professors, because
they cannot estimate the ultimate consequences
of individual exertion. But reflecting
people must perceive that, in time, desultory
efforts may be reduced into a system founded
on principles calculated to strengthen and preserve
both the health of our bodies, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
energy of our minds, thus facilitating the acquisition
of human knowledge.</p>

<p>Exercise on foot is allowed to be the most
natural and perfect, as it employs every part
of the body, and effectually promotes the circulation
of the blood through the arteries and
veins.&mdash;“<span class="smcap">Walking</span>,” says Dr. Willich<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, “the
most salutary and natural exercise, is in the
power of every body; and we can adapt its
degree and duration to the various circumstances
of health. By this exercise the appetite
and perspiration are promoted; the body
is kept in proper temperament; the mind is
enlivened; the motion of the lungs is facilitated;
and the rigidity of the legs arising
from too much sitting, is relieved. The most
obstinate diseases, and the most troublesome
hysteric and hypochondriacal complaints, have
been frequently cured by perseverance in
walking.”</p>

<p>Pedestrian feats, even when carried to excess,
are seldom attended by any pernicious
effects. The exhaustion occasioned by severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
exercise is only temporary; for the wearied
frame is speedily recruited by the luxury of
rest and refreshment. But certain rules may
be observed, which will render walking both
easy and agreeable. A light, yet firm and
manly step, an erect posture, especially in regard
to the head, the breast, and the shoulders,
should be the chief objects of attainment.
By care and attention a person may
thus learn to walk gracefully, and with little
bodily fatigue<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

<p>Early and constant practice gradually forms
the pedestrian for the accomplishment of the
greatest undertakings: but even in the common
intercourse subsisting in society, facility
of walking is requisite for individual conveniency
and comfort. It should, therefore, be
the study of people of all ranks, to adopt the
best method of performing either short or long
journies, by imitating the <span class="smcapuc">GAIT</span> and <span class="smcapuc">MANNER</span> of
those celebrated men, who, of late years, have
so eminently distinguished themselves in the
annals of the sporting world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The extraordinary exploits of modern pedestrians
have been generally encouraged by the
patronage of men of fortune and rank; and
<span class="smcapuc">FOOT-MATCHES</span> being made the subject of discussion,
a difference of opinion gives occasion
for wagers. Although it was maintained by
Sir Charles Banbury, and some other eminent
sportsmen, that a bet should not be taken on
a <span class="smcapuc">FOOT-RACE</span>; yet, in reason, there can be no
legitimate objection to such things, as whatever
may be deemed doubtful, or of uncertain
result, must be a fair subject of betting.</p>

<p>Many astonishing feats of pedestrianism
have been accomplished during the last and
present century; but it does not suit the
limits of this work to record the whole of
them, or even to enumerate all the exploits of
every person who has been distinguished.&mdash;We
can only relate the most conspicuous performances
of those who have acquired celebrity
by their general success, and whose
matches, either against others, or against time,
have attracted public attention. It would fill
volumes to particularize every <span class="smcapuc">WALK</span> or <span class="smcapuc">RACE<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></span>
that exceeds the power of ordinary men; and,
therefore, we shall confine our narration to
matches of difficult accomplishment. Accordingly,
and for the purpose of perspicuity,
we have thought proper generally to arrange
them into different classes.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>First, Matches of several days continuance,
and which required great strength and perseverance.</p>

<p>Secondly, Those which were accomplished
in one day, and shewed great strength and
agility.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Those which were performed in
one or more hours, and required good wind,
and great agility; and,</p>

<p>Lastly, Those completed in seconds, or in
minutes, and showed great swiftness.</p>

</div>

<p>In accomplishing long matches against time,
it must be observed, that considerable speed
is fully as requisite as strength; for no man
could walk a hundred miles in one day, if he
were not able to go for several hours at the
rate of six miles an hour; and it will be
found, in general, that those who have performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
great distances, were also remarkable
for agility and swiftness.</p>

<p>Robert Bartley, of Hutford in Norfolk,
who was born anno 1719, was distinguished in
his youth for extraordinary speed; and, when
an old man, frequently walked from Thetford
to London in one day&mdash;a distance of eighty-one
miles&mdash;and returned the next. He was
well known among the sporting men of Newmarket
as a great walker, and died in the
sixty-sixth year of his age.</p>

<p>Reed, the noted pedestrian of Hampshire,
in 1774, ran ten miles within an hour, at the
Artillery Ground, London. In 1787, he
walked one hundred miles in one day at Gosport;
and on the sands of Weymouth, in
1791, he performed fifty miles in little more
than nine hours.</p>

<p>In May 1762, Child, the miller of Wandsworth,
walked forty-four miles in seven hours
and fifty-seven minutes, on Wimbledon Common;
and in August the same year, Mr. John
Hague of Binns near Marsden, performed one
hundred miles in twenty-three hours and fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Foster Powell was the most celebrated
pedestrian of his time; and in the performance
of long journies has seldom been equalled.&mdash;In
1773, he walked from London to York,
and back again, in six days, for a wager of
one hundred guineas. In the same year, he
beat Andrew Smith, a famous runner, on Barham
Downs, in a match of one mile. In
1776, he ran two miles in ten and a half minutes,
on the Lea-bridge road, but lost his
match by half a minute. In September 1787,
he walked from the Falstaff Inn at Canterbury
to London Bridge, and back, in ten minutes
less than twenty-four hours, being a distance of
one hundred and nine miles. On the 8th June
1788, he set out from Hicks’ Hall on a second
journey to York, and back again, which he
accomplished in five days, nineteen hours,
and fifteen minutes. In the July following,
he walked one hundred miles in twenty-two
hours. In 1790, he took a bet of twenty guineas
to thirteen, that he would walk from London
to York, and return, in five days and eighteen
hours, which he performed in less time than
was allowed, by one hour and fifty minutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
He was so fresh on his return, that he offered
to walk a hundred miles the next day for a
considerable wager. In the same year, he
went from Hyde Park corner to Windsor,
and back, in seven hours. In July 1792, he
undertook to walk from London to York, and
back, in five days and fifteen hours, which he
accomplished within his time by an hour and
twenty-five minutes. In 1792, when in the
fifty-seventh year of his age, he offered to walk
six miles in one hour; to run a mile in five
minutes and a half; and to go five hundred
miles in seven days. He required a bet of
one hundred guineas on the last undertaking,
and twenty guineas on either of the other two.
But no person appearing to accept his offer,
he afterwards declined all pedestrian performances
for wagers.</p>

<p>This celebrated pedestrian was born in the
year 1736, at Horsforth, near Leeds, in Yorkshire.
He was bred to the profession of the
law, and was clerk to an attorney in New Inn,
London. He was beat by West of Windsor,
in walking forty miles on the western road,
for a wager of forty guineas. He was, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
a first-rate walker for either a long or a
short journey; and his stature was no more
than five feet eight inches; but his legs and
thighs were stout, and well calculated for performances
of this kind.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Edge, of Macclesfield in Cheshire,
in 1806, when at the age of sixty-two, walked
one hundred and seventy-two miles in forty-nine
hours and twenty minutes. He started
from the Angel Inn at Macclesfield, at twelve
o’clock on Wednesday night, and arrived at
the Swan with Two Necks, Ladlane, London,
at twenty minutes past one on Saturday morning.
This performance is remarkable from
the age of the pedestrian, who walked at the
rate of three miles, three furlongs, thirty-five
perches, and 11/74ths feet per hour.</p>

<p>Long journies have been frequently performed
at the rate of from fifty to eighty miles
a day, for four, six, eight, ten, or more successive
days, which have evinced the great
strength and perseverance of the pedestrians.</p>

<p>In July 1788, John Batty, when fifty-five
years of age, walked seven hundred miles in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
fourteen days on Richmond Course. He performed
this long journey at the following
rate: first day, fifty-nine miles: second, fifty-five
and three-quarters: third, fifty-two and
three-quarters: fourth, fifty-one: fifth, fifty-one:
sixth, fifty-one: seventh, forty-three:
eighth, forty-two and three-quarters: ninth,
forty-four and three-quarters: tenth, fifty-one:
eleventh, fifty-one: twelfth, fifty-four
and a half: thirteenth, fifty-one: and on the
fourteenth day, thirty-six miles and a quarter,
having finished the whole distance within five
hours of the time allowed.</p>

<p>In 1792, Mr. Eustace walked from Liverpool
to London in four days. He was then
seventy-seven years of age, and the distance
exceeds two hundred miles. On a journey
from Chester to London, when eleven years
younger, he went ninety miles the first day.</p>

<p>Mr. Downes is well known as a first-rate
pedestrian. In February 1808, he walked
four hundred miles in ten days for a bet of a
hundred guineas. He was greatly fatigued
by the exertion; and his weight was reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
more than two stones. He performed thirty-five
miles a day for twenty successive days,
without much difficulty. He walked twenty
miles in two hours and forty minutes, on the
11th of July 1809. He matched himself to
go thirty miles in three hours and a quarter,
for a bet of one hundred guineas; but the
task was evidently beyond his power, and he
failed in the undertaking. He was more fortunate,
however, in a match with the celebrated
Captain Aiken, which took place this
year, on the 26th September, at Thorpe, in
Hampshire. The bet was, which of them
should go the greater distance in forty-eight
hours. They started together at the extremities
of a piece of ground of five miles, and met
each other. Mr. Downes walked ninety miles
the first day, and rested two hours. His adversary
went eighty-eight miles, and had only
an hour to rest. On the second day, Mr.
Downes had accomplished seventy-two miles,
and had five hours to spare. Captain Aiken
had done only fifty-six in the same time, and
therefore resigned the match.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>In April 1808, Mr. Podgers walked four
hundred miles in eight successive days, for a
wager of two hundred guineas. He started
at Basingstoke, and from Hampshire went into
the counties of Wilts, Gloucester, Somerset,
Sussex, and Kent, finishing at Maidstone.
He walked twelve hours each day, and slept
eight. His weight was fourteen stones, and
he did not appear the least fatigued at any
period of the journey.</p>

<p>Mr. Dowler, a publican at Towcester, Northamptonshire,
walked five hundred miles in
seven successive days, for a bet of one hundred
guineas. He started on the 3d of November
1808, and finished on the 9th, at three
o’clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Captain Howe is a celebrated pedestrian,
and walked three hundred and forty-six miles
in six days, for a wager of two hundred guineas.
He started on the 8th of March 1808,
at four in the morning, to go from London to
Exeter, and made out sixty-four miles by nine
at night, having stopped at Basingstoke for an
hour. On the following day he walked seventy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
miles; and on the third day, arrived at Exeter
to dinner, where he stopt three hours, but returned
to Honiton to sleep. On the fourth
day, he reached within nine miles of Salisbury;
and on the fifth night, slept at a public
house near Basingstoke. He had now forty-nine
miles to perform on the sixth day, which
accomplished by six o’clock in the evening.
Captain Howe, on the 28th of the same month,
gained a match of two hundred guineas against
Captain Hewetson, having walked eighty miles
in less than twenty-four hours.&mdash;He also beat
Mr. Smith in a twenty mile race on the Uxbridge
road, about the end of October 1809.
Mr. Smith was the favourite before starting;
but Captain Howe performed the distance in
two hours and twenty minutes, beating his
adversary by half a mile.</p>

<p>On the 9th of June 1812, Captain Howe
undertook to go sixty miles in twelve hours
for a wager of two hundred guineas. He
started at four o’clock in the morning, and
did half the distance in twelve minutes less
than six hours. He continued at the rate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
five miles in the hour, and won the match
within ten minutes of the time allowed.</p>

<p>Mr. Canning, a gentleman in Hampshire,
walked three hundred miles in less than five
days. He started at the turnpike road four
miles from Basingstoke, at four in the morning,
and went sixty miles in fourteen hours.
He finished his task two miles from Yeovil in
Somersetshire, by eleven at night, on the fifth
day. He was apparently so little fatigued,
that probably he could have continued for
several days; but in the course of the journey,
he lost twenty-six pounds in weight.</p>

<p>Mr. Rimmington, a farmer at Holt near
Dorchester, in October 1811, walked five hundred
and sixty miles in seven days, at the rate
of eighty miles a day, for a wager of two hundred
guineas. He was much emaciated by
this extraordinary exertion, and became very
lame towards the close.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Halifax, of the Lancashire militia,
walked two miles an hour for one hundred
successive hours, near Tiverton in Devon, in
March 1808. This was a great performance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
as he could not have more than fifty minutes
rest at one time, during four days and nights.
He was much distressed: his legs were swollen,
and his whole frame was exhausted. His
courage, however, never failed him; and he
completed the task amidst the shouts of the
multitude that this extraordinary experiment
had attracted.</p>

<p>Thomas Savager, who died in 1809, in the
seventy-fifth year of his age, was a noted
pedestrian, although only five feet and four
inches in stature, and lame from his youth.
In 1789, he undertook to walk four hundred
and four miles, in six days. The scene of his
performance was on the turnpike road from
Hereford through Leominster to Ludlow;
and he won his wager within five hours of
the time allowed. When the superfluous
ground over which he walked to his lodgings
at Hereford, Ludlow, &amp;c. was added, it was
found that he had walked not less than four
hundred and twenty-nine miles in five days
and nineteen hours.</p>

<p>On the 18th of September 1811, Mr. Mealing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a gentleman of fortune in Somersetshire,
started to go five hundred and forty miles, at
the rate of thirty miles a day, for eighteen
successive days, and to perform the distance
in eighteen different counties, which he accomplished,
and won five hundred guineas.
He was reduced from fourteen stone eight
pounds, to twelve stone four pounds.</p>

<p>To walk one hundred miles within twenty-four
hours may be considered an extraordinary
exertion; but that distance has been
performed in that time by several people:
and a great deal more has been accomplished
by some of our most celebrated pedestrians.</p>

<p>Mr. Oliver, in July 1811, walked one hundred
miles in twenty-three hours and fifty
minutes. He was much fatigued, but that
he was not entirely exhausted, was apparent
from his going the last ten miles in two hours.&mdash;Mr.
Edward Millen, in July the previous
year, accomplished the same distance in
twenty-three hours and twenty-five minutes.&mdash;But
we shall have occasion afterwards to
record more difficult performances than these;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and, in the meantime, shall take notice of the
feats of such pedestrians as have evinced uncommon
strength and agility, and who have
been distinguished by walking a long distance
in a short time.</p>

<p>In September this year (1812), Jonathan
Waring, a Lancashire pedestrian, performed
one hundred and thirty-six miles in thirty-four
hours, for a wager of one hundred guineas.
He started from London to go to Northampton,
and return. He went the first fifty-five
miles in twelve hours, and half the distance
in fourteen hours and a half. After resting
an hour and a half, he started on his return,
and accomplished the whole distance in three
minutes less than the time allowed. He was
excessively fatigued.</p>

<p>But Glanville, a Shropshire man, accomplished
a more extraordinary performance in
the year 1806. He walked one hundred and
forty-two miles on the Bath road in twenty-nine
hours and three-quarters. He started
from the 14th mile-stone to go to the 85th, and
back, at seven in the morning, on the 26th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
December, and arrived at his journey’s end
next day, at a quarter before one o’clock in
the afternoon. He went off at the rate of six
miles an hour, and reached Twyford at five
minutes past ten, where he took a basin of
soup. He refreshed again at Marlborough,
and arrived at the 85th mile-stone at ten minutes
past eight in the evening. This part of
his journey was performed at the average rate
of nearly five miles and a half an hour. He
returned a few miles on his way back, and refreshed
himself on a bed for an hour and a
half, and reached Reading at a quarter past
six in the morning of the 27th. He had now
twenty-five miles to go in five hours and three-quarters,
and appeared to be much fatigued.
After remaining twenty minutes, he renewed
his task, and arrived at his journey’s end at a
quarter before one o’clock&mdash;winning, with
great difficulty, by a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>This performance is the most extraordinary
upon record, and bets were seven to four, and
two to one against him; but his strength and
perseverance overcame every difficulty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
thus enabled him to accomplish the astonishing
exploit.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 20th July 1804, John Bell,
Esq. engaged to walk from Brook Green to
Hammersmith&mdash;a distance of fifty-eight miles&mdash;in
fourteen hours, for a bet of two hundred
guineas; which he performed, with apparent
ease, in thirteen hours, and forty-five seconds.&mdash;A
distance of sixty miles was performed on
the 18th of September, the same year, by a
butcher of Whitechapel, in eleven hours and
a quarter, for a bet of seventeen guineas.</p>

<p>On the 14th of August 1807, a distance of
sixty-nine miles was performed near Lyndhurst,
in twelve hours, by Wall, a hawker, on
the Bath road. He was matched against
Campbell of Dowton, Wilts, a man of local
notoriety. The pedestrians started about four
miles from Christ Church, at eleven o’clock,
morning. By four, Wall had gone thirty-five
miles. He was at the same time passed by
Campbell; but having rested for half an hour,
he overtook his opponent by nine o’clock. A
severe struggle now ensued, and they kept together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
until ten; when Wall made an extraordinary
push, and went nearly eight miles
in the last hour, beating his adversary by a
mile and a half. In this match, the winner
walked five miles and three-quarters per hour
on the average, including the time he refreshed,
which, allowing for the distance, must be
considered a very extraordinary effort.</p>

<p>In August 1809, Captain Walsham, of the
Worcestershire regiment of militia, walked
the distance of sixty miles in twelve hours,
with ease; and afterwards rode thirty miles on
two curricle horses, in two successive hours,
for a wager of one hundred and twenty guineas.</p>

<p>Mr. Hopper of Canterbury, walked sixty-three
miles in eleven hours and thirty-nine
minutes. He started from the turnpike on
St. Martin’s Hill, and at the end of the first
hour he had gone seven and a half miles: second
hour, eleven miles, including stoppage
for breakfast: third hour, and five minutes,
twenty miles: fourth hour, twenty-six miles:
fifth hour, thirty-four miles: sixth hour, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
dinner, thirty-five miles: seventh hour,
forty-one miles: eighth hour, forty-five miles:
ninth hour, fifty-one miles: tenth hour, fifty-five
miles: eleventh hour, sixty miles: and
at thirty-eight and three-fourth minutes past
the eleventh hour, he finished sixty-three
miles, apparently much fatigued.</p>

<p>A distance of fifty miles was performed in
nine hours, on the 28th of March 1811, by
Clough, a groom, on the Bath road, for a
wager of fifty guineas. He regularly walked
six miles an hour for the first five hours; and
his average rate of travelling was five miles,
one half, and one ninth part of a mile, per
hour.&mdash;Eighty miles, at two starts, were performed
by Shoreham, a publican, on the 22d
of April the same year. He started from
Paddington to go to Nettlebed, Oxfordshire,
and to return. He went forty miles in six
hours and a half, and after resting three hours,
he accomplished the other forty miles in six
hours and forty minutes, having completed
the distance in thirteen hours and ten minutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
which was at the rate of more than six
miles per hour.</p>

<p>On the 15th of April 1812, Lieut. Groats
undertook for a wager of two hundred guineas
to go seventy-two miles in twelve hours. He
went from Blackfriars road to Canterbury, and
thence back to Stroud. He performed the
first fourteen miles in two hours. When he
had gone sixty miles he was much fatigued,
but by the aid of refreshment and rubbing,
he was enabled to proceed, and accomplished
the distance within six minutes of the time
allowed.</p>

<p>Six miles per hour, for any distance from
twenty-four to forty miles, must be considered
as very superior walking, although several of
the most celebrated pedestrians have exceeded
that rate.&mdash;Mr. Pearson performed thirty-seven
miles in five hours and twenty-seven
minutes, for a wager of one hundred guineas.
He started from Pimlico to go to Datchet-bridge
near Windsor, and return, at three
o’clock in the morning of the 11th July 1807.
He went off on a shuffling walk, and stopt at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Honslow at a quarter past four, where he refreshed.
He halted again at Colnbrook, at
twenty-five minutes past five, and reached
Datchet-bridge in fifteen minutes; half the
distance having been performed in two hours
and forty minutes. As he had only gained
a few minutes on time, bets were three and
two to one against him; but in returning, he
quickened his pace, and arrived at Honslow,
at twenty-seven minutes past seven o’clock,
much fatigued.</p>

<p>On the 13th of January 1810, William Staniland
walked fifty-four miles in seven hours
and three-quarters, for a wager of eighty guineas.
He set off from Driffield at seven in
the morning to go to Hull, where he arrived
at half-past ten, and having gone round the
statue in the market-place, he returned to
Driffield at a quarter before three, being fifteen
minutes within the time allowed.</p>

<p>Mr. Yardly accomplished forty-two miles in
six hours and ten minutes, which was nearly
at the rate of seven miles an hour on the average.
He started in the morning of the 12th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of June, and went twenty-one miles in three
hours; nineteen miles and a half in the other
three hours; and the remaining mile and a
half in ten minutes.</p>

<p>Thomas Miller, of Cowford in Sussex, on
the 7th of July 1795, walked from the market-house
at Horsham to Westminster Bridge&mdash;a
distance of thirty-six miles&mdash;in five hours and
fifty minutes, with apparent ease.</p>

<p>John Jones, a Welchman, and William Williams,
a Lancashire man, ran thirty miles on
the Hereford road, on Monday the 12th of
June 1809, for a wager of five hundred guineas.
Williams had the better of his antagonist
for the first twenty miles; but Jones soon
after passed him, and won the race in three
hours and three-quarters.</p>

<p>Spence, a chairman in Paisley, went from
the cross of Glasgow to Edinburgh&mdash;a distance
of forty-two miles&mdash;in seven hours and
twenty minutes, without much apparent fatigue.</p>

<p>Mr. Ensor, clerk of Highgate Chapel, undertook,
in September 1806, to walk twenty-six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
miles in four hours, for a bet of fifty guineas.
He started from the first mile-stone
at Hammersmith, at seven o’clock, and went
the first seven miles within the hour, and accomplished
the whole distance in three hours
and forty-three minutes.</p>

<p>On the 26th of October 1805, Mr. King, an
optician, undertook to walk the same distance
in the same time, for a bet of thirty guineas.
He started from the first mile-stone at Hammersmith,
and reached the 17th, beyond Colnbrook,
in one hour and fifty minutes, and returned
to the place whence he had started
seventeen minutes within his time, performing
the whole distance in three hours and forty-three
minutes.</p>

<p>A bet of fifty guineas having been made
between Captain Hare and Mr. Cortey of
Wigmore Street, that the latter should not go
from Sevenoaks to Blackfriars Bridge, in two
hours and forty minutes, on the 17th of
April 1809;&mdash;the pedestrian started on the
day appointed, and although the weather was
extremely unfavourable, he did nine miles in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the first hour, and eight miles and a half in
the second. He had now forty minutes to
perform the remaining five miles and a half;
the whole distance being twenty-three miles.
But the weather was so extremely severe as
to beat him to a stand-still a mile from the
Bricklayers’ Arms, when he resigned.</p>

<p>On Friday the 4th June 1807, Mr. Stevens
undertook to go from the Woolpack at St.
Albans, to Finsbury Square,&mdash;a distance of
twenty-one miles&mdash;in three hours, for a bet of
four hundred and fifty guineas. He started
at a quarter before two o’clock in the morning,
and arrived at his journey’s end by four.
He ran in the first hour, seven miles and a
half; in the second hour, ten miles; and in
the last quarter, three miles and a half.</p>

<p>A match for twenty miles was run on the
12th September 1809, on a piece of chosen
ground near Maidenhead, between Mr. Greig
and Matthew Mark, for fifty guineas a side.
Mark took the lead at the rate of eight miles
an hour, closely followed by his antagonist.
They were equal at ten miles, having performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that distance in one hour and eight
minutes. They both made play here, and at
nineteen miles were together; but Mr. Greig
gained by two minutes only. The race
throughout was well contested; and the
whole distance was accomplished in two
hours and twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Captain Thomson of the 74th regiment,
while stationed at Aberdeen in the year 1808,
undertook to walk twenty-one miles in three
hours. He started on the 5th of May at the
7th mile-stone on the Ellon road, returning to
the 4th, until he should perform the distance,
which he accomplished in four minutes and a
half less than the time allowed.</p>

<p>On the 22d of February 1812, James Watson,
a glazier, for a wager of £10, went from
Whitechapel Church to Romford in Essex, and
back, in three hours, the distance being twenty-three
miles. He started at six o’clock, and
reached Romford at twenty minutes past seven.
Having refreshed ten minutes, he started again
on his return, and completed the distance in
four minutes less than the given time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 11th of February 1812, Mr. Webber
undertook, for a bet of one hundred guineas,
to ride nine miles within half an hour, and to
run five miles in another half hour. He started
at Two-mile Brook, near Colnbrook, Bucks,
and performed the nine miles in a light sulky,
in four minutes less than the given time. He
now started on his pedestrian match, and went
four miles in a few seconds less than twenty-four
minutes, labouring under great distress;
but he recovered his wind, and won the match
in six seconds within the time.</p>

<p>Mr. Froward of Berkeley-street, on the 14th
of April 1812, performed thirty miles in three
hours and fifty-three minutes, for a wager of
twenty guineas.</p>

<p>To walk or run for two or three hours at the
rate of eight miles an hour, may be deemed
extraordinary speed, conjoined to considerable
strength and command of <span class="smcapuc">WIND</span>. But
more than nine miles an hour have been accomplished
on a distance of twenty miles;
and upwards of eight on a distance of forty.</p>

<p>A man named Blewet from Crewkerne, Somersetshire,
for a small wager, undertook to
go twenty-four miles in three hours. On the
5th of September 1808, he started at four
o’clock from Shoreditch Church, and reached
Theobalds in Hertfordshire, at twenty minutes
past six, having stopped at Edmonton four or
five minutes. He refreshed, and remained
here ten minutes, when he started on his return,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and after stopping again at Edmonton,
arrived at the starting post at fifty-two minutes
past seven. Including stoppages, Blewet, who
was a young man, performed the twenty-four
miles in two hours and thirty-four minutes, or
at the rate of more than nine miles an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. Harwood performed eighteen miles in
two hours, on Monday the 26th of October
1811, on the Bath road, for a wager of one
hundred guineas.</p>

<p>Rickets, the celebrated Hampshire pedestrian,
ran seventeen miles in one hour and
forty-nine minutes, for a wager of five guineas.
The same distance was performed on
the 10th of October 1807, by a man of the
name of Keeley, fifty-four years of age, in
one hour and fifty-seven minutes. He started
at six in the morning from Shoreditch Church
to go to Ponder’s End, and back again, being
allowed two hours for the performance. He
reached Ponder’s End at six minutes before
seven, and stopped ten minutes to refresh,
when he started again, and returned within
three minutes of his time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>In April the same year, a young man, named
Whitlock, performed the same distance in one
hour and fifty minutes. He started from
Shoreditch at half-past five, and reached Ponder’s
End at twenty minutes past six; stopped
there to refresh ten minutes, and returned to
the starting post at twenty minutes past seven
o’clock, having gone, exclusive of the stoppage,
at the rate of somewhat more than ten
miles an hour.</p>

<p>Twenty miles in two hours and twenty minutes
have been performed by Howe, Smith,
Greig, and other celebrated pedestrians.&mdash;Eighteen
miles were done in one hour and
fifty-three minutes by a youth of seventeen
years of age, named Bentley, on the 18th
of June 1810. He started from the end of
Smithfield at five, and reached Whitestone ten
minutes before six. After taking some refreshment,
he resumed his journey back, and
arrived at the starting post at seven minutes
before seven o’clock.</p>

<p>In October 1808, Mr. Williams, steward to
Mr. Crouch of Wigmore Street, undertook to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
go twenty miles in two hours. He started at
Hammersmith, and notwithstanding the unfavourable
state of the weather, he accomplished
the task in seven minutes less than
the time allowed.</p>

<p>The distance of ten miles within an hour
has been frequently performed, and a shorter
distance in proportionally less time.</p>

<p>About the beginning of last century, Levi
Whitehead of Bramham in Yorkshire, when in
the twenty-second year of his age, ran four
miles over Bramham-moor in nineteen minutes,
which was at the rate of somewhat more than
twelve miles in an hour. He was the swiftest
runner of his day, and won the buck’s head
for several years at Castle Howard, given by
the earl of Carlisle. The five Queen Anne’s
guineas given by William Aisleby, Esq. of
Studley, were won by him; on which occasion
he beat ten others who were selected
to start against him. He lived to the age of
one hundred; and in his ninety-sixth year he
frequently walked from Bramham to Tadcaster,
at the rate of four miles in the hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 1771, Chr. Orton ran from
Middleham to Richmond, Yorkshire, in fifty-seven
minutes. The distance is ten computed
miles; the road remarkably hilly; and several
horses were much distressed to keep up with
him.</p>

<p>On the 13th of July 1793, John Barrett ran
ten miles on Kersal Moor, near Manchester,
for a wager of twenty guineas, against Henry
Wilkinson, from Warrington in Lancashire,
and beat him with ease, performing the distance
in fifty-seven minutes. He also, in the
month of August following, beat Wilson of
Tenterden in Kent, on Barham Downs, in a
match of five miles, which he accomplished in
twenty-seven minutes and nine seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. Haselden of Milton, in August 1809,
undertook to go ten miles within an hour,
which he performed on the Canterbury road,
between Key Street and Chalkwell, with considerable
ease, in fifty-three minutes;&mdash;and
Mr. O’Callagan ran the same number of miles
on the Edgeware road, near the village of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Kilburn, in fifty-eight minutes and forty-seven
seconds.</p>

<p>In June 1805, a match was run on the Uxbridge
road, between Lieut. Warren and Mr.
Bindall, an artist, for fifty guineas. The distance
was seven miles; and they started at
four in the morning. The lieutenant continued
to lead for four miles, when Mr. Bindall
passed him, and won the bet, by leaving his
opponent a quarter of a mile behind, and performing
the distance in thirty-five minutes.</p>

<p>On the 10th of December 1808, a match
for five miles took place between Mr. George
Frost of Horringer, and Mr. Richard Butters
of Ixworth on the Newmarket road, near
Bury. The race was well contested, and
won by Mr. Frost, who performed the distance
in thirty minutes.</p>

<p>In August 1805, the distance of four miles
was performed in three seconds less than
twenty-one minutes, by James Farrer, of Lancashire,
at Knutsford, for a wager of two
hundred guineas.</p>

<p>Captain Parfet undertook to run four miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in twenty-four minutes at four starts, the
whole however to be done within three-quarters
of an hour, which he accomplished on the
Hampton road, on the 27th of December
1808. He ran the first mile in five minutes
and a second. After waiting five minutes he
did the second mile in five minutes and a
half; and the third mile in six minutes and
forty-nine seconds. Having rested twenty
minutes, the captain started again, and performed
the fourth mile in five seconds less than
the time allowed. This gentleman stands only
five feet four inches, and is of thick stature.</p>

<p>On the 21st of July 1777, Joseph Headley
of Riccal near York, ran two miles on Knavesmire,
in nine minutes and forty-five seconds,
for a wager of one hundred guineas. About
a month before, he ran four miles over the
same ground in twenty-one minutes. He was
allowed to be the swiftest runner at that time
in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Joseph Beal of Welburn Moor-houses, near
Castle Howard, Yorkshire, ran two miles in
nine minutes and forty-eight seconds, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
York race-course, the 9th September 1811,
beating Isaac Hemsworth of Bolton in Lancashire.
Beal is one of the swiftest runners in
the kingdom, and he challenged all England
for a four-mile match. The Lancashire men
accepted it, and were allowed one month to
find an antagonist, and one month for training
him. The noted Abraham Wood was
fixed upon as the competitor of Beal. These
pedestrians accordingly started about one o’clock,
on Wednesday the 13th of October.
Wood took the lead, and kept it for nearly a
mile, when Beal passed him with ease. Wood
again headed his opponent, but before he
reached the two-mile post, Beal passed him,
and, keeping the lead, won the race apparently
with ease, beating Wood about two
hundred yards, and performing the whole distance
in twenty-one minutes and eighteen
seconds. Beal is a youth only nineteen years
of age, five feet seven inches high, and weighs
no more than nine stones and seven pounds.</p>

<p>To run a mile within five minutes requires
great agility, and none but swift runners could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
accomplish it, yet that distance has frequently
been performed in less time.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallis, a gentleman residing in Jermyn
Street, ran two miles in nine minutes, at two
starts, in February 1808. And on the 17th
of the same month, a mile was performed at
one start by Mr. E. Haslern, in four minutes
and fifty seconds.&mdash;Captain Anning, on the
3d of March 1809, ran a mile in the same time
near Hampton, having been matched against
a man named Forbes, from Eaton, whom he
beat by two hundred yards.&mdash;Captain Hewetson
ran two miles on the Uxbridge road, on
the 21st of March 1809, at two starts, in three
seconds less than ten minutes, for a bet of
fifty guineas.&mdash;A mile was performed in four
minutes and ten seconds, by John Todd, a
Scotchman, in 1803, who ran from Hyde Park
corner to the first mile-stone on the Uxbridge
road.</p>

<p>On the 2d of May 1809, a match took place
in Bayswater Fields, between Captain Dacre
and Mr. Dawes, for a mile. The bet was
twenty guineas on the contest between them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and another twenty that the captain should
not go the distance in five minutes. They
started at the fire of a pistol, and ran together
until within a hundred yards of the end, when
the captain made a push, and won by about
two lengths, the performance having occupied
four minutes and fifty-six seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. Francis Martin, Tewkesbury, ran half
a mile in two minutes and eight seconds, for a
wager of one hundred guineas. The time allowed
was two minutes and a half. Bets were
two to one against him at starting, but he accomplished
the task apparently with ease.</p>

<p>On Friday the 6th July 1804, a well contested
match for a mile, took place between
Lord Frederic Bentinck, and the Hon. Edward
Harbord, for a bet of one hundred guineas.
The ground chosen, was from the second to
the third mile stone on the Edgeware road;
and they started about three o’clock, <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span>
The race was closely run for more than half
the way, when Mr. Harbord, owing to superior
strength, gained considerably on his antagonist,
whom he left at a great distance behind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
The mile was accomplished in five minutes
and a few seconds. On Tuesday following,
his lordship ran a match against Mr.
Mellish over the Beacon Course for fifty guineas,
which he also lost by about fifty yards;
Mr. Mellish having performed the distance in
thirty-eight minutes and ten seconds.</p>

<p>On the 1st of June the following year, Mr.
Harbord again entered the lists as a swift
runner, against Lord F. Beauclerk. They
started in Lord’s cricket-ground; but the distance
being only a hundred yards, and his
lordship getting the advantage at first, Mr.
Harbord was unable to make up in so short
a space, and lost the match by two yards.&mdash;But
he afterwards ran the same distance
against Mr. Lambert, whom he beat almost
without a struggle. On the 15th of July
1807, Lord F. Beauclerk beat the Hon. Mr.
Brand in a short race, in Lord’s cricket-ground,
the latter gentleman becoming quite
<span class="smcapuc">WINDED</span><a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> before he had run fifty paces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hon. Colonel Douglas of the Forfarshire
militia, is a swift runner. He accomplished
a mile within five minutes, and has
performed shorter distances with great celerity.</p>

<p>Curley, better known by the title of the
<span class="smcap">Brighton Shepherd</span>, is a swift runner for a
short space. He ran a mile at four starts in
four minutes, on Clapham Common, in October
1807. He was beat, however, by Grinley
the boot-closer. They ran a match, in
November 1805, of one hundred and twenty
yards, on the walk leading to the gates of
Kensington Garden, which was accomplished
in twelve seconds and a half, Grinley beating
his antagonist by half a yard. On the 25th
of August next year, they again ran one hundred
and twenty yards at Hampton Court
Green, for a bet of one hundred and twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
guineas, which Grinley also gained by two
yards, performing the distance in twelve seconds.
Curley was more fortunate in a match
which took place on the 22d of June 1807,
with Cooke the soldier, whom he beat by two
yards, on a distance of one hundred and forty.</p>

<p>Cooke performed two hundred yards in
twenty seconds, on the 19th September 1808.
He entered into a match with a gentleman of
the name of Williams, to run that distance in
Lord’s cricket-ground, for a wager of fifty
guineas. They both started at the same instant,
and kept together for the first hundred
yards, when Cooke took the lead until they
did fifty more. Mr. Williams then came up
with him, and they ran elbow to elbow for
another forty yards. Cooke again took the lead,
and kept it to the winning-post, beating his
adversary by a yard and a half.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Hawkey, and Mr. Snowden of
Nottingham Street, ran a well contested match
on the 14th of November 1808, for a bet of
fifty guineas, which was gained by the latter
gentleman.&mdash;And Skewball, the famous Lancashire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
shepherd, performed one hundred and
forty yards in twelve seconds, near Hackney,
in February 1808.</p>

<p>Captain Aiken has acquired considerable
celebrity as a swift runner, and for any distance
under five miles, his performances have
been seldom exceeded. He undertook three
matches for fifty guineas each: 1st, To run
one hundred yards within twelve seconds; 2d,
To go two hundred yards in twenty-eight seconds;
and, 3d, To do a quarter of a mile in
one minute and twenty seconds. He started
on the Uxbridge road, on the 23d of June
1809; and the first match he lost by a second;
the next he won with difficulty; and the third,
he gained by two seconds. He performed a
quarter of a mile on the Twickenham road, in
one minute and fifteen seconds; and on the
26th of July 1809, he started for two bets of
twenty guineas each; first, to go a mile in five
minutes, and after an interval of one minute,
to run a mile against Mr. Sullivan. The first
he accomplished in two seconds under the
time; and the second he performed in five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
minutes and twenty-five seconds, beating his
antagonist by about one hundred yards. In
the month of November the same year, he ran
four miles on a spot of ground near Maidenhead,
in twenty-three minutes and fifty seconds,
for a wager of one hundred guineas.
On the 5th January 1810, Captain Aiken beat
Mr. Athol by one hundred yards on a mile,
which he performed in five minutes and twelve
seconds; and on the 19th of November, he
did five miles in twenty-nine minutes and
fifty-four seconds, for a wager of fifty guineas.
He also performed one mile and a half within
eight minutes, on the 4th of March 1812, at
Ashford, for a bet of one hundred guineas.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Fairman is a noted pedestrian,
but his performances are not so astonishing as
those of many others, who of late years have
distinguished themselves either by their great
strength, or uncommon agility. He is remarkable,
however, for undergoing a great
deal of fatigue without any refreshment.</p>

<p>He took a bet of one hundred guineas with
Colonel Lockhart, that he would go sixty miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
in fourteen hours, on Friday the 9th November
1804. A single mile of the race-course
at Ipswich was measured off, and he started
at two o’clock in the morning. He went the
first seventeen miles at the rate of nearly six
miles an hour, when he refreshed. He then
went off in good style, and did thirty-two
miles, including the stoppage, in six hours.
He halted here for some time, having been
rubbed down with hot towels, his feet soaked
in warm water, and his body bathed all over
with spirits. He shifted his clothes and breakfasted.
He again started about twenty minutes
before nine, to perform the remaining
twenty-eight miles. He went twelve miles
farther, when he halted for a few seconds, and
ate a piece of bread steeped in Madeira. This
stage was finished in about three hours, which
left him four hours and a half to the last sixteen
miles. He stopt once more at the end
of ten miles, and took a small piece of bread
as before. He had now only six miles to go,
which he did in one hour and forty-eight minutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
accomplishing the whole distance in
thirteen hours and thirty-three minutes.</p>

<p>During the performance of this match,
Lieutenant Fairman, contrary to the practice
of other pedestrians, refused to take animal
food. His breakfast was tea and toast, and
when he stopt to refresh, he ate only a small
piece of bread steeped in Madeira.</p>

<p>On the 12th January 1808, he performed
upwards of twenty miles in four minutes less
than three hours. He started from Cumberland
Gate precisely at eleven minutes past
ten o’clock, to go to Harrow, and back, which
he accomplished by seven minutes past one.</p>

<p>This gentleman’s style of walking is peculiar,
and therefore deserves to be mentioned.
“His arms are compressed, and pinioned close
to his sides, and their weight is supported by
a loop pendent from each shoulder, into which
he places his thumbs.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Fairman carried his pedestrian
spirit into the regions of the torrid zone, and
in defiance of a tropical climate and a vertical
sun, he entered the list’s with a Mr. Grant, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the colony of Curacao, (August 1808) whom
he completely ran down in two hours and
twenty-five minutes, having gone upwards of
eleven miles without halting or refreshing.
His adversary, who is a native of the Indies,
presumed on being able to bear the violence
of the heat better than Mr. Fairman, and consequently
appointed twelve o’clock mid-day,
for the commencement of the contest. But
he was mistaken, and obliged to acknowledge
the superiority of the European pedestrian,
who candidly confessed that although he had
been successful, yet he experienced more distress
from this performance than he had ever
done in Europe, in accomplishing feats of infinitely
greater speed and continuance.</p>

<p>Captain Agar may be considered one of the
most celebrated pedestrians of the present day,
either for a short or a long distance; and he
lately accomplished a very arduous undertaking.
On the 13th of June 1809, he matched
himself for one hundred guineas, to go five
miles within half an hour, and to walk, heel
and toe, the first five minutes; which he performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
on the Staines road with considerable
ease. But his greatest feat was the accomplishment
of fifty-nine miles in eight hours
and a half, which took place on Tuesday the
7th of April 1812. He started from his residence
in Kensington, to go to Blackwater in
Hampshire, and return, for a stake of two hundred
guineas. He arrived at Ashford Common
in two hours and ten minutes (seventeen
miles,) and refreshed at Englefield Green, in
five minutes less than three hours from starting,
(twenty-one miles.) He continued steadily
going on until he did half the journey in
four hours and four minutes. After being
well rubbed, he resumed his undertaking, and
went seven miles an hour tolerably true, but
was much distressed during the last two hours.
He completed the distance, however, winning
his match by three minutes within time, so
that the fifty-nine miles were accomplished in
exactly eight hours and twenty-seven minutes.</p>

<p>Captain Agar also lately performed a very
extraordinary undertaking. He matched himself
for a bet of two hundred guineas to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
three hundred miles in four days. He started
from the Edgeware road on the 1st of June, and
did ninety miles within the first twenty-four
hours; eighty the second day; seventy-two
the third; and fifty on the fourth day. He
was much distressed during the last day’s performance.</p>

<p>Mr. Jaques, on the 3d of October 1807,
walked fifty miles in eight hours, near Honslow
Heath. He went nearly seven miles the
first hour; thirteen, in two hours; twenty in
three hours; and the remainder, in two hours.
Half the distance was performed in three
hours and fifty minutes; and Mr. Jaques won
his match, quite fresh, although he appeared
to be much fatigued when he had gone only
thirty miles.</p>

<p>With the exception of Captain Barclay,
Abraham Wood, of Mildrew in Lancashire,
holds the first rank among pedestrians. He
is a remarkably fine, tall, well-made man, and
is not only a swift runner, but is also possessed
of good <span class="smcapuc">WIND</span> and great <span class="smcapuc">BOTTOM</span>. In April
1802, he ran against John Brown of Yorkshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
four miles on the York course, for one
hundred guineas, which he won in twenty
minutes and twenty-one seconds. Wood was
the favourite, and the bets were five to one on
his success. Brown, however, five years before,
(the 16th January 1797,) beat Wood in
a race of four miles, near Knavesmire, by
about a distance, having performed the whole
in twenty-one minutes and thirty-five seconds.
But some liquor having been given to Wood
just before starting, he fell sick at the three-mile-stone,
and, owing to this circumstance,
it was supposed he lost the match. On the
23d of August 1802, he ran four miles for
four hundred guineas, against William Williams
of Ruglyn in Glamorganshire, over Lautrissent
Course in Wales, which he won easily.
Betting was even at starting, but after running
two miles, twenty to one were offered
on Wood.</p>

<p>On Monday the 14th of June 1806, a match
for four hundred guineas was decided between
Wood and Jonathan Powlitt, a famous Lancashire
pedestrian, in favour of the former.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
The parties started to run five times round
what is called the four-mile course at Doncaster;
and for the first mile they ran elbow to
elbow; after which, Wood took the lead for
about forty yards, and continued so till nearly
the four-mile winning post, when Powlitt made
an exertion, passed him, and led for about ten
yards, when Wood again took the lead, apparently
with ease, and, passing his antagonist
several yards, continued to leave him for the
remaining three rounds.</p>

<p>Wood did not appear to be the least distressed,
and ran the distance in fifty-one minutes
and twenty-four seconds, Powlitt being
nearly a minute longer. The distance was exactly
nine miles, one-quarter, and three hundred
yards; twice round the course at Doncaster
being three miles, three quarters, and
thirty-two yards.</p>

<p>The rounds were as under:</p>

<p>Before starting, and in returning the first
round, bets were two to one on Wood; in
the second round, five to two, and three to
one; in the third round, five and six to one;
and afterwards, twenty to one on Wood.</p>

<p>In October following, Wood undertook to
run twenty miles in two hours and a quarter,
which he performed on the Brighton course
with great facility in two hours, five minutes,
and a few seconds. He ran the first ten miles
in one hour and one minute, which turned
the betting in his favour; for at starting, it
was greatly against him. A few days afterwards,
he ran a quarter of a mile in a minute,
and performed it with apparent ease about a
second within the time.</p>

<p>On Thursday the 16th of April 1807, this
noted pedestrian ran forty miles over Newmarket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
heath, in four hours and fifty-six minutes,
being four minutes within the time allowed
to perform the match. He ran the first
eight miles in forty-eight minutes, and the
first twenty miles in two hours and seven minutes.
The stake, it is said, was five hundred
guineas; and, during the race, the odds were
two and three to one in his favour. He ran
without shoes or stockings, and had only a
pair of flannel drawers, and a jacket upon
him. He did not at any time appear to be
fatigued, and few of the riders were able to
keep their horses up with him.</p>

<p>Wood’s next sporting performance was his
match with Captain Barclay, in which he failed.
But as a particular account of that match
shall be given, when we treat of Captain Barclay’s
performances, it is not requisite at present
to notice it farther. On the 12th of May
1809, Wood gained a severe and well contested
race with Shipley from Nottinghamshire.
It was run over Knutsford Heath&mdash;the
distance four hundred and forty yards,
which was performed in fifty-six seconds;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and so close were the competitors, that the
judges were for some time doubtful to which
of them they should assign the stake, (being
two hundred guineas); but finally it was determined
in favour of Wood. On the 9th
September 1811, Wood ran a two-mile match
with Joseph Beal, which he lost, as previously
mentioned in page 76.</p>

<p>Of all the celebrated pedestrians of the present
day, Captain Barclay is deservedly the
most famous, both from the variety and difficult
accomplishment of his performances;&mdash;and
the next Chapter shall be devoted to his
astonishing exploits, of which a particular and
faithful account shall be presented to the
reader.</p>

<span class="smaller">CAPTAIN BARCLAY’S PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MATCHES.</span></h2>

<p>Captain Barclay early displayed a
strong predilection for the manly sports, and
when only fifteen years of age, he entered into
a match with a gentleman in London to
walk six miles within an hour, fair <span class="smcapuc">TOE AND
HEEL</span>, for one hundred guineas, which he accomplished
on the Croydon road, in the month
of August 1796.</p>

<p>His next performance took place two years
after, (August 1798) and he was equally successful.
He matched himself against Ferguson,
a celebrated walking clerk in the city, to
go from Fenchurch Street, London, to the
10th mile-stone beyond Windsor, and back.
Capt. Barclay performed the distance (seventy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
miles), notwithstanding the heat of the weather,
in fourteen hours, beating the clerk several
miles.</p>

<p>In December the year following, he accomplished
one hundred and fifty miles in two
days, having walked from Fenchurch Street
to Birmingham, round by Cambridge. A few
days afterwards, he returned in the same time
by the way of Oxford.</p>

<p>In November 1800, he walked sixty-four
miles in twelve hours, including the time requisite
for taking refreshment. He started
from Ury at twelve at night, and went to
Ellon in Aberdeenshire, where he breakfasted,
and returned by twelve mid-day. This
walk was performed as a trial preparatory to
a match he had undertaken to accomplish
in December following. He had engaged
to go ninety miles in twenty-one hours and
a half, for a bet of five hundred guineas,
with Mr. Fletcher of Ballingshoe, a gentleman
of <span class="smcapuc">TURF</span> notoriety; but unfortunately, he
caught cold after one of his <span class="smcapuc">SWEATS</span> while
training, and became so ill, that he was unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to start on the day appointed, and the
match of course was lost.</p>

<p>Capt. Barclay, next year, 1801, appeared
very conspicuously in the annals of the sporting
world. He again betted with Mr. Fletcher,
that he would walk ninety miles in
twenty-one and a half successive hours. The
bet was two thousand guineas, and the ground
chosen for the performance of the match was
the line of road from Brechin to Forfar, in the
county of Angus. He accomplished sixty-seven
miles in thirteen hours; but having incautiously
drank some brandy, he became instantly
sick, and consequently unable to proceed.
He now renounced the bet, and the
umpire retired; but after two hours rest, he
completely recovered, and could easily have
finished the remainder of the distance within
the time.</p>

<p>In June the same year, he walked from Ury
to Boroughbridge in Yorkshire, in five days,
a distance of three hundred miles, notwithstanding
the heat of the weather, which was
then very oppressive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Although Capt. Barclay had lost two considerable
bets with Mr. Fletcher of Ballingshoe,
he was still confident of being able to
perform ninety miles in twenty-one hours and
a half; and again matched himself to go the
distance within that time, for five thousand
guineas, to be decided in the month of November.</p>

<p>He immediately went into training under
Mr. Smith, an old farmer on Lord Faulconberg’s
estate, who was reckoned very knowing
in all sporting science, and very skilful in the
best mode of training for pedestrian feats. In
the month of October, he made an experimental
trial in his lordship’s park, and went
one hundred and ten miles in nineteen hours
and twenty-seven minutes. The state of the
weather was extremely unfavourable, as it
rained all day, and he was up to the ancles in
mud. Considering every circumstance, this
performance may be deemed the greatest upon
record, being at the rate of upwards of one
hundred and thirty-five miles in twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>By the agreement, Capt. Barclay was to
give Mr. Fletcher eight days notice of the
day on which he was to start. The time was
accordingly fixed for Tuesday the 10th of November;
and the ground on which the bet
was to be decided, was the space of one mile
on the high road between York and Hull,
about sixteen miles from the former place.
The contracting parties measured the ground,
and a post was fixed at the end of the mile.
In turning this post, it required a pace and
a half additional each mile, which were not
taken into the measurement. Persons were
stationed at the winning post to notch down
the rounds, and to observe that every thing
was done in a fair manner. On each side of
the road, a number of lamps were placed for
the purpose of giving light during the darkness
of the night. On Monday evening,
Capt. Barclay appeared on the ground, accompanied
by several of his friends, a few
minutes before twelve o’clock; and Mr. Fletcher
also attended. Precisely at twelve,
six stop watches were set, and put into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
box at the winning end, which was sealed.
At the same time, Capt. Barclay started. He
was dressed in a flannel close shirt, flannel
trowsers and night-cap, lambs’-wool stockings,
and thick-soled leather shoes.</p>

<p>He went the two first miles in twenty-five
minutes and ten seconds, and continued nearly
at the same rate till he had gone sixteen miles,
when he halted. The house into which he
went to refresh, was situated near the right
side of the course, about ten yards from the
road-side, which, in going and coming, made
twenty yards, not included in the measurement.
He remained about ten minutes in
taking refreshment and changing clothes,
when he proceeded with his match, went fifteen
miles more, and then refreshed and changed
as before.</p>

<p>At seven in the morning, which was rather
hazy, Capt. Barclay appeared to be somewhat
dull from the dampness of the night
air. Betting, however, was two to one, and
five to two in his favour. After refreshing,
he was more cheerful, and went sixteen miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
more, with much apparent strength, going
each two miles in about twenty-five minutes
and twenty seconds. By eleven, he had gone
fifty miles, and appeared to proceed on his
course with great ease and vigour.&mdash;Betting
was now four and five to one in his
favour.</p>

<p>When he had gone sixty miles, he stopped
to refresh, and change clothes. He remained
about ten minutes in the house, and came out
in high spirits, with much cheerfulness in his
countenance. Betting was now in his favour
six and seven to one. He proceeded till he
had gone seventy miles, scarcely varying in
regularly performing each round of two miles
in twenty-five minutes and a half, when he
again refreshed and changed clothes. He
appeared well and strong, and resumed his
match in a gallant style.</p>

<p>He refreshed twice more, and performed
the whole distance by twenty-two minutes
four seconds past eight o’clock on Tuesday
evening, being one hour, seven minutes, and
fifty-six seconds within the specified time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>When he had finished, he was so strong and
hearty, and in fact so well, that he could have
continued for several hours longer, and might
have gone twenty or thirty miles farther.&mdash;Thousands
of spectators on foot and on horseback,
attended during the course of his walking,
and he was loudly huzzaed, and carried
on the shoulders of the multitude.</p>

<p>In August 1802, Capt. Barclay walked from
Ury to Dr. Grant’s house at Kirkmichael, a
distance of eighty miles, where he remained a
day and night, (but without going to bed,)
and came back to Ury by dinner on the third
day, returning by Crathynaird, which lengthened
the journey twenty miles. The roads
over which he performed this journey, were extremely
rugged, being through the mountainous
parts of Aberdeenshire, and the distance
altogether was one hundred and eighty miles.</p>

<p>In June next year, he undertook to run a
match for a mile and a half against Burke, the
celebrated pugilist, whom he beat with ease.
In the month of July, he walked from Suffolk
Street, Charing Cross, to Newmarket, in ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
hours, in one of the hottest days of the season.
The distance is sixty-four miles, and he was
allowed twelve hours to perform it, which he
did in two hours less.</p>

<p>In December following, he first appeared in
the sporting world as a swift runner. He had
performed long journies beyond the power of
any man living, which was attributed to his
great strength and bottom; but it was generally
supposed that he did not possess fleetness
sufficient to enable him to cope with any
of the first-rate runners. The <span class="smcapuc">KNOWING ONES</span>,
however were deceived; for Capt. Barclay
proved, that even at a very short distance, he
had few competitors. He started in Hyde
Park to run a quarter of a mile against Mr.
John Ward, and bets were two to one in favour
of his antagonist. Ward took the lead,
and kept it for the first three hundred yards.
Capt. Barclay then beat up, and they ran the
next hundred yards neck and neck. In the
last forty, Ward lost ten yards; and Capt.
Barclay accomplished the whole distance, four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
hundred and forty yards, in fifty-six seconds,&mdash;Mr.
Fletcher Reid and the Hon. B. Craven,
were the umpires.</p>

<p>In March 1804, Capt. Barclay undertook,
for a wager of two hundred guineas, to walk
twenty-three miles in three hours. It was intended
that he should start in Hertfordshire,
and finish at the Royal Exchange, London.
But unfortunately, on the day appointed he
was taken ill, and consequently lost his stake.
The sporting world were thus disappointed;
and any odds would have been laid that he
should have completed the task.</p>

<p>On Thursday the 16th of August, Capt.
Barclay, who was then a lieutenant in the 23d
regiment of foot, and quartered at East Bourne
in Suffolk, engaged to run two miles in twelve
minutes. He accomplished this undertaking
with apparent ease, in two seconds and a half
within the time. The arduousness of the task
was greatly increased by the excessive rain
which had fallen during the two preceding
days, and a high wind that blew in his face.
He ran the first mile in five minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 18th of the following month, a
match, to run one mile for one hundred guineas,
was performed at East Bourne between
Capt. Barclay and Capt. Marston of the 48th
regiment. Both gentlemen were such celebrated
pedestrians, that the race attracted
some hundreds of spectators, and a great deal
of money was sported. Capt. Marston being
known by the regiment as a swift runner,
found many to back him. They started at
an early hour. Capt. Barclay suffered his
competitor to take the lead, and keep it for a
short distance, when he passed him, and continued
a-head to the end of the race, which
he accomplished in five minutes and seven
seconds, notwithstanding the intense heat of
the day. Mr. Fletcher Reid attended as the
umpire. At the same place, Capt. Barclay
ran a mile against John Ireland of Manchester,
one of the swiftest runners in that quarter,
on the 12th of October, for a bet of five
hundred guineas. Ireland gave in at three-fourths
of the mile; but Capt. Barclay performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the whole distance in four minutes
and fifty seconds.</p>

<p>In 1805, Capt. Barclay performed two long
walks, at the rate of more than six miles an
hour. In March, he went from Birmingham
to Wrexham in North Wales, by Shrewsbury,&mdash;a
distance of seventy-two miles,&mdash;between
breakfast and dinner. And in July following,
he walked from Suffolk Street, Charing Cross,
to Seaford in Sussex&mdash;a distance of sixty-four
miles&mdash;in ten hours.</p>

<p>In June this year, he had entered into a
match with Capt. Cook, to take place on the
19th, at Epsom course. As both gentlemen
were celebrated runners, a great concourse of
people assembled, among whom were many
fashionable females. Capt. Cook did not
make his appearance, but Capt. Barclay,
more punctual to his engagements, came forward,
and ran triumphantly over the ground,
winning the whole of his bets, which were
very considerable.</p>

<p>In June this year, (1806) Capt. Barclay
walked from Suffolk Street, Charing Cross, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Colchester in Essex&mdash;a distance of fifty-five
miles&mdash;without stopping to breakfast. In the
course of the day, he rowed from Gravesend,
and back.</p>

<p>On Monday the 4th August this year, a
match took place between Capt. Barclay and
Mr. Goulbourne, late of the Royal Horse
Guards. The celebrity of the two gentlemen
raised the expectations of all the amateurs;
and the distance being only a quarter of a
mile, made the odds in favour of Mr. Goulbourne,
which were about six to four at starting.
Capt. Barclay immediately took the
lead, his opponent keeping close behind him
for the first three hundred yards, which were
run in great style: But here Mr. Goulbourne’s
strength entirely failed him, and Capt. Barclay
ran the remainder of the distance alone. He
performed the whole four hundred and forty
yards in one minute and two seconds.&mdash;This
race was performed in Lord’s cricket
ground, Mary-le-bone.</p>

<p>In December this year, Capt. Barclay accomplished
the arduous performance of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
hundred miles in nineteen hours, over the
worst road in the kingdom, and just at the
break of a severe storm. He started from Ury
to go to Crathynaird, and back. He went to
Charlton of Aboyne, (twenty-eight miles) in
four hours, where he stopped ten minutes;
then went forward to Crathynaird, (twenty-two
miles,) where he remained fifty minutes. He
then returned to Charlton, where he refreshed
for thirty minutes, when he proceeded to Ury,
and completed the whole distance in nineteen
hours. Exclusive of stoppages, the distance
was performed in seventeen hours and a half,
or at the rate of about five miles and three-quarters
each hour, on the average.</p>

<p>Capt. Barclay was attended in this walk by
his servant, William Cross, who also performed
the distance in the same time. In the month
of December 1808, Cross walked one hundred
miles in nineteen hours and seventeen minutes
on the Aberdeen road, near Stonehaven. He
stands five feet and eight inches, is well made,
and active, and may be considered a first-rate
pedestrian.</p>

<p>In May next year, (1807,) Capt. Barclay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
walked seventy-eight miles in fourteen hours,
over the hilly roads of Aberdeenshire. He
left Ury at two o’clock morning, to attend a
sale of cattle at a place four miles beyond
the Boat of Forbes on the Don, a river
in Aberdeenshire, where he remained five
hours, but walked in the fields several miles,
and returned home by nine at night.&mdash;In this
year, his famous match, for two hundred guineas,
with Abraham Wood, the celebrated
Lancashire pedestrian, took place.</p>

<p>It was settled in the month of July, that
the parties were to go as great a distance as
they could in twenty-four hours&mdash;and Capt.
Barclay was to be allowed twenty miles at
starting&mdash;to be decided at Newmarket on the
following 12th of October&mdash;play or pay.</p>

<p>On the day appointed, this match attracted
the greatest concourse of people ever assembled
at Newmarket, in the memory of
the oldest inhabitant. Carriages of every description
were innumerable, from the barouche
and four, to the dicky cart, and the horsemen
and pedestrians exceeded all accurate calculation
of numbers. The place chosen for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
performance of this extraordinary match, was
a single measured mile on the left-hand side
of the turnpike-road leading from Newmarket
to London, towards the ditch; which mile
was roped in, and both competitors ran on
the same ground.</p>

<p>They started precisely at eight o’clock on
Monday morning, but after going forty miles,
Wood resigned the contest, which created
considerable surprize among the amateurs.&mdash;The
following is an accurate account of the
race.</p>

<p>When the pedestrians had performed the
above number of hours, Wood resigned the
contest; but Capt. Barclay walked four miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
farther to decide some bets. Wood made
play at starting, and went eight miles within
the first hour, as appears from the foregoing
statement. For three hours he continued at
a lounging run, when the odds, which were
about three to one at starting, were reduced
to about seven to four. He got off one
mile in the first half hour, having performed
four miles in one minute less than that time.
He accomplished twenty miles in two hours
and forty-one minutes; and by coming in the
twenty-two miles within three hours, he had
got off four miles of the twenty he had given
to Capt. Barclay, and both pedestrians came
in together. After having gone twenty-four
miles in three hours and sixteen minutes,
Wood took refreshment for five minutes in a
marquee at the starting post, opposite to that
of his competitor. After having gone thirty-two
miles, he laid himself down and rested
for ten minutes, appearing to be somewhat fatigued.
His ancles and body were rubbed,
and on leaving his marquee, he appeared without
his shoes. The next four miles he slackened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
his pace, and was above twenty minutes
in going two miles. Wood’s feet were
cut by travelling without his shoes, and he
put them on; but after having gone forty
miles in six hours and twenty minutes, he retired
to his marquee: and shortly after, it was
communicated to the spectators that he had
resigned the match.</p>

<p>Capt. Barclay pursued a steady course of
six miles an hour, without varying a minute.
After having gone eighteen miles he stopped,
and refreshed by taking some warm fowl;
and when he had accomplished other eighteen
miles, he again stopped; but while taking
another refreshment, Wood’s failure was announced
to him, and he walked the other four
miles merely to determine some depending
bets.</p>

<p>The unexpected termination of this race
excited considerable surprise in the sporting
world, as it was known to most people present,
that Wood, only a few months before, had
gone forty miles in less than five hours. Several
of those who had betted on Wood declined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
paying, from the suspicion of something
unfair having taken place. But it was
manifest to all, that there was no collusion between
Capt. Barclay and the other party, and
he had not the slightest suspicion of any thing
unfair existing.</p>

<p>When the match was first proposed, Capt.
Barclay refused to make it, without a gentleman
was concerned for Wood, and after such
was sought for, a publican in the vicinity of
Spitalfields was brought forward to back him.
He accordingly stood one hundred and fifty
pounds of the stake-money; but it was well
known that he never before risked twenty
pounds on the issue of any uncertain event.
Wood had gone fifty miles in seven hours, in
a wet day, while training, and was desirous of
continuing his journey, being very fresh; but
was stopped, lest he should be injured by the
unfavourable state of the weather: of course,
a great deal was expected from him.</p>

<p>These, and several other concurring circumstances,
induced some sporting men to decline
paying their bets. The disputes on this head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
were finally settled at Tattersal’s, when, after
a good deal of discussion, it was the opinion
of a considerable majority, that the bets ought
not to be paid, as it was then well known, that
liquid laudanum had been administered to
Wood by some of his pretended friends, after
he had gone twenty-two miles. The regular
frequenters of Newmarket, however, maintained,
that the bets ought to be paid, although
they were of opinion <span class="smcapuc">THE RACE WAS
THROWN OVER</span>, or, at any time a man may get
off from his wagers.&mdash;Capt. Barclay’s bets,
which were considerable, were paid.</p>

<p>This match, on the part of Wood and his
friends, was entirely hopeless; for no man in
the world could, with the least prospect of
success, allow Capt. Barclay twenty miles on
a walk to be decided in twenty-four hours.
He had previously walked, without the advantage
of training, <span class="smcapuc">SEVENTY-EIGHT MILES IN
FOURTEEN HOURS</span>, and what is still more astonishing,
had performed <span class="smcapuc">SIXTY-FOUR MILES IN
TEN HOURS</span>. If no accident, therefore, had
occurred, it is highly probable, he would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
accomplished one hundred and thirty-five
miles, which would have obliged his opponent
to have gone one hundred and fifty-five miles,
a distance altogether beyond Wood’s power,
and such as never has been performed in that
time by any pedestrian, either ancient or modern.</p>

<p>As an additional instance of Capt. Barclay’s
great strength and perseverance, it may be
mentioned, that, merely for his amusement,
he performed a most laborious undertaking in
August this year, (1808). Having gone to
Colonel Murray Farquharson’s house of Allanmore,
in Aberdeenshire, he went out at five
in the morning to enjoy the sport of grouse-shooting
on the mountains, where he travelled
at least thirty miles. He returned to dinner
to the colonel’s house, by five in the
afternoon, and in the evening set off for Ury,
a distance of sixty miles, which he walked in
eleven hours, without stopping once to refresh.
He attended to his ordinary business
at home, and in the afternoon walked to Laurence-kirk,&mdash;sixteen
miles,&mdash;where he danced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
at a ball during the night, and returned to
Ury by seven in the morning. He did not
yet retire to bed, but occupied the day by
partridge-shooting in the fields. He had thus
travelled not less than one hundred and thirty
miles, supposing him to have gone only eight
miles in the course of the day’s shooting at
home, and also danced at Laurence-kirk,
without sleeping, or having been in bed for
two nights and nearly three days.</p>

<p>In December following, he was matched
against a runner of the Duke of Gordon, to
go from Gordon Castle to Huntly Lodge, a
distance of nineteen miles, which Capt. Barclay
performed in two hours and eight minutes,
without any previous preparation, and
immediately after breakfast, beating the duke’s
man five miles. He ran the first nine miles
in fifty minutes, although the road was very
hilly, and extremely bad.</p>

<p>In October this year, (1808,) Capt. Barclay
made a match with Mr. Wedderburn Webster,
a gentleman of celebrity in the sporting world,
which attracted the notice of the whole kingdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and raised the highest expectations among
the amateurs of pedestrian exploits.</p>

<p>He engaged to go on foot, <span class="smcapuc">ONE THOUSAND
MILES IN ONE THOUSAND SUCCESSIVE HOURS</span>, at
the rate of a mile in each and every hour, for
a wager of one thousand guineas, to be performed
at Newmarket-heath, and to start on
the following 1st of June, (1809).</p>

<p>Previously to encountering this arduous
match, Capt. Barclay went to Brighton, where
he remained for a short time for the sake of
sea-bathing and fresh air. He did not then
deem it necessary to go under regular training,
as he believed the undertaking would be
easily accomplished.</p>

<p>He arrived at Newmarket on the 30th of
May; but he had before that time provided
lodgings for his accommodation, and the
ground on which he was to perform had been
marked out. It was on a public road leading
from the house of Mr. Buckle, where he lodged,
and by no means adapted to his purpose.
His resting apartment was on the ground-floor
fronting the south, and only separated from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the kitchen by a small room, where the attendants
sat. Thus accommodated, he undertook
the match under various disadvantages.</p>

<p>On the sixteenth day, however, he removed
to new lodgings near the <span class="smcap">Horse and Jockey</span>,
where he continued during the remainder of
the time. He also shifted his ground, and
walked across the Norwich road up the heath
for half a mile out and return.</p>

<p>The difficulty of accomplishing this astonishing
match may be conceived, when it is
known that the most celebrated pedestrians of
England have attempted it, and failed. The
constant exertion, with the short time allowed
for sleep, must soon exhaust the strongest
frame; and no other man has been able to
continue longer than about thirty days.</p>

<p>Mr. Howe started at Cliffe Common, Somersetshire,
to perform the Barclay match;
but at the end of fifteen days he resigned the
task, and thus lost his stake of three hundred
guineas, besides his health being much injured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Blackie undertook the match, but on
the twenty-second day of his labour, he became
afflicted with swollen legs to a frightful
degree, and resigned on the twenty-third day,
reduced from fourteen stones six pounds to
eleven stones.</p>

<p>Mr. Martindale failed on the 27th of May
1812, after having gone thirty days. He
wasted twenty pounds, and was much injured
in his legs and feet.</p>

<p>When Capt. Barclay started, his weight was
thirteen stones and four pounds; but when
weighed in Chiffeny’s (the jockey) scales, after
finishing, and resting seventeen hours in
bed, his weight was reduced to eleven stones,&mdash;thus
losing, in the course of his performance,
no less than two stones and four pounds.</p>

<p>Towards the conclusion, the spasmodic affections
in his legs were particularly distressing;
but it is an astonishing fact, that his
appetite continued to the end as good as ever.
To this fortunate circumstance, the accomplishment
of the match may be ascribed. If
the digestive powers of the stomach had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
injured by the excessive fatigue, extreme debility
must have ensued, and his labours would,
no doubt, have terminated in the same manner
as those of the other gentlemen who have attempted
this match.</p>

<p>He breakfasted, after returning from his
walk, at five in the morning. He ate a roasted
fowl, and drank a pint of strong ale, and
then took two cups of tea with bread and butter.
He lunched at twelve; the one day on
beef-steaks, and the other, on mutton-chops,
of which he ate a considerable quantity. He
dined at six, either on roast beef, or mutton-chops.
His drink was porter, and two or
three glasses of wine. He supped at eleven
on a cold fowl. He ate such vegetables as
were in season; and the quantity of animal
food he took daily was from five to six pounds.</p>

<p>He walked in a sort of lounging gait, without
apparently making any extraordinary exertion,
scarcely raising his feet more than two
or three inches above the ground.</p>

<p>His dress was adapted to the changeable
state of the weather. Sometimes he walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
in a flannel jacket, and sometimes in a loose
dark grey coat, but he always used strong
shoes and lamb-wool stockings.</p>

<p>Bets were from the beginning in his favour,
and they rose to two to one and five to two;
but, about eight days before he finished,
they were ten to one on his accomplishing
the match, at Tattersal’s, and other sporting
places. On Wednesday morning, (the day
he completed the task,) one hundred guineas
to one were offered; but so strong was the
confidence of his success that no bets could
be obtained at any odds.</p>

<p>This extraordinary performance was concluded
on the 12th of July, at thirty-seven
minutes past three in the afternoon, amidst
thousands of spectators. The multitude who
resorted to the scene of action being unprecedented,
not a bed could be procured on the
previous night at Newmarket, Cambridge, or
at any of the towns and villages in the vicinity;
and every horse and vehicle were engaged.
The influx of company had so much
increased on Sunday, that the expediency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
roping in the ground was suggested; but
Capt. Barclay objected to the measure as indicating
too much parade. On Monday, however,
the crowd became so great, and he experienced
so much interruption, that he consented
to allow this precaution to be taken,
and next morning the workmen began to rope
in the ground.</p>

<p>Among the distinguished company who
witnessed the conclusion of this arduous undertaking,
we may include the Dukes of Argyle
and St. Alban’s; Earls Grosvenor, Besborough,
and Jersey; Lords Foley and Somerville;
Sir John Lade, and Sir Francis
Standish.</p>

<p>The following particulars relative to Capt.
Barclay’s state of health, and other circumstances
which occurred during this celebrated
walk, were furnished to the author by a gentleman

perfect fidelity.</p>

<p>This statement, it is hoped, will be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>First day.&mdash;After walking the second mile,
Capt. Barclay stript off his clothes and went
to bed: he did not sleep, and perspired profusely.
(Throughout this match, when he went
to bed, he always undressed.) He slept little the
first night, and next day nothing particular occurred;
but the weather being very hot, he had
a great tendency to perspire after walking.</p>

<p>Second day.&mdash;He slept rather better the
second night. At this time, he did not go to
bed during the day, but walked in the streets
of Newmarket, or occasionally rested on a
sopha. He was still inclined to perspire.</p>

<p>Third day.&mdash;Twelve o’clock noon; in good
health.&mdash;Twelve at night; slept well, and still
fresh, but much inclined to perspire.</p>

<p>Fourth day.&mdash;Twelve, noon; the dust on
the road incommoded him much, but he was
still fresh, with a good appetite.&mdash;Twelve at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
night; slept well, looked fresh, and had no
complaint.</p>

<p>Fifth day.&mdash;Twelve, noon; quite well.&mdash;Twelve,
night; slept every time he lay down,
and started at the first call, fresh and well.</p>

<p>Sixth day.&mdash;Twelve, noon; fresh, and in
good spirits.&mdash;Twelve, night; in good health,
and not fatigued.</p>

<p>Seventh day.&mdash;Twelve, noon; in good health
and spirits.&mdash;Twelve, night; slept well, and in
good spirits.</p>

<p>Eighth day.&mdash;Twelve, noon; in good health
and spirits.&mdash;Twelve, night; quite well, and
slept every time he went to bed.</p>

<p>Ninth day.&mdash;Twelve, noon and night; in
good health and cheerful.</p>

<p>Tenth day.&mdash;Twelve, noon and night; in
good health and spirits, but seemed fatigued
in consequence of the rain and high wind
which continued during the night and morning.</p>

<p>Eleventh day.&mdash;Twelve, noon; appeared
as well as usual; appetite good; but kept
more within doors, and more frequently reclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
on a sopha.&mdash;Twelve, night; slept well;
started immediately when called; appeared in
good health and spirits; and persevered with
courage.</p>

<p>Twelfth day.&mdash;Twelve, noon; kept more
within doors, and more frequently reclined on
the sopha, but appeared in good health and
spirits.&mdash;Twelve, night; slept well, but complained
of pains in the back of his neck and
shoulders, occasioned, as he supposed, by not
wearing a sufficient quantity of clothes during
the night, and by sitting with his back towards
an open window, after being in a state of perspiration
from the walk.</p>

<p>Thirteenth day.&mdash;Three, morning; at this
time felt a little pain in his legs, particularly
in the back tendons; but in every other respect
he was as well as ever.&mdash;Twelve, noon;
in good health and spirits, but complained
of slight pains in his neck and shoulders.&mdash;Twelve,
night; slept well; appeared refreshed
by sleep, and went on with cheerfulness.</p>

<p>Fourteenth day.&mdash;Three, morning; felt rather
more pain in his legs, but no remedy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
applied.&mdash;Twelve, noon; felt no pain; very
cheerful, and appeared in good health.&mdash;Twelve,
night; at this hour, felt no pain;
was somewhat dull, but walked as usual, and
slept soundly.</p>

<p>Fifteenth day.&mdash;Two, morning; felt some
pain in his legs, but it was nothing of consequence,
and did not impede his walking; slept
well, and appeared in good health.&mdash;Three,
morning; felt more pain than before, particularly
at starting; when he had gone a hundred
yards the pain ceased, and in other respects
he was quite well.&mdash;Twelve, noon; felt
no pain, looked fresh, and went on with cheerfulness.&mdash;Twelve,
night; the pain in his legs
had returned, and it gradually increased till
three o’clock in the morning, when it was at
the worst; but it wore off as the day advanced:
He was still in good health.</p>

<p>Sixteenth day.&mdash;Three, morning; the pain
in his legs increased, but in other respects the
same as before.&mdash;Five, morning; the pain
going off, and in good health and spirits.&mdash;Seven,
morning; almost free from pain, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
very cheerful.&mdash;Twelve, noon; at this hour,
Capt. Barclay removed to new lodgings, and
new ground. His victuals were not cooked
in the house, and in all respects he was more
comfortably lodged than before.&mdash;Twelve,
night; the pain in the legs returned; was
somewhat stiff, and did not sleep well, but was
still cheerful.</p>

<p>Seventeenth day.&mdash;Three, morning; at this
hour seemed rather dull and heavy; pains in
the thighs as well as in the legs; his walking
somewhat impeded, particularly at starting,
but became better when he had gone two or
three hundred yards.&mdash;Five, morning; felt
less pain, and was in better spirits.&mdash;Seven,
morning; much better, the pain going off,
and cheerful.&mdash;Nine morning; quite well;
felt no pain; in excellent spirits, and was
much the same throughout the day.&mdash;Twelve,
night; rather stiff; felt some pain in his legs
and thighs, but was in tolerable spirits.</p>

<p>Eighteenth day.&mdash;Three, morning; rather
dull; complained of the pain in his legs and
thighs; stiff at first starting, and appeared as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
if he had been somewhat lame.&mdash;Five, morning;
felt less pain, and was more lively.&mdash;Seven,
morning; much better; felt little pain,
and was in good spirits.&mdash;Nine, morning; nothing
appeared to be the matter with him;
much the same throughout the day, and very
cheerful.&mdash;Nine, evening; rather heavy; at
this time the pain returned, and increased
throughout the night and morning; he was
always worst at three o’clock, but gradually
recovered as the day advanced.&mdash;Eleven,
night; felt more pain, and was more stiff, but
slept well, and was still in good spirits.</p>

<p>Nineteenth day.&mdash;One, morning; the pain
increasing.&mdash;Three, morning; felt more pain
in his legs and thighs, and experienced more
difficulty in walking, especially at starting.&mdash;Five,
morning; considerably better; the pain
going off, and in tolerable spirits.&mdash;Seven,
morning; much better; scarcely felt any
pain.&mdash;Nine, morning; as well as ever; pain
gone off, and in good spirits; cheerfully persevering,
and nearly the same throughout the
day, but lay down more frequently, and generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
slept.&mdash;Eleven, night; rather worse; felt
some pain; not so cheerful as during the day,
and walked somewhat heavily.</p>

<p>Twentieth day.&mdash;One, morning; worse;
with more pain than last hour; stiff and dull.&mdash;Three,
morning; much pain in his thighs
and legs; some difficulty in walking until he
had gone a few hundred yards; slept well,
and always started at the first call.&mdash;Five and
seven, morning; much better; felt less pain,
and walked with more ease.&mdash;Nine, morning;
still felt some pain in his legs, particularly at
starting.&mdash;He was not so well throughout the
day as usual, owing, in a great measure, to the
extreme heat of the weather. His legs were
bathed several times with vinegar; but he
was still in good health, and his appetite the
same as at the commencement.&mdash;Nine, evening;
still felt some pain, but it did not affect
his walking, and he was in good spirits.&mdash;Eleven,
evening; pain increasing, and somewhat
stiff in his motion.</p>

<p>Twenty-first day.&mdash;One, morning; much
worse; pain increased; walked heavily, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
not in good spirits.&mdash;Three, morning; at this
time felt much pain in the back parts of his
legs; could not walk with ease, and complained
a little on the <i>tread</i> of his right foot.&mdash;Five,
morning; somewhat better; did not
feel so much pain, and walked with more ease.&mdash;Seven,
morning; much better; the pain
considerably abated.&mdash;Nine, morning; in good
spirits; still felt a little pain in his thighs and
legs, which continued throughout the day;
bathed them frequently in vinegar; his foot
better in consequence of the application of
vinegar.&mdash;Nine, evening; about this time began
to feel the pain increasing; walked rather
heavily, but was in good spirits.&mdash;Eleven,
night; felt more pain; somewhat stiff, particularly
at starting, but was still in good spirits.&mdash;During
this day, Capt. Barclay lay down
every time he returned from his walk, and
was rather more stiff than during the preceding
day.</p>

<p>Twenty-second day.&mdash;One, morning; felt
much pain.&mdash;Three, morning; pain continued,
but not so violent as at the same hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the preceding day, and he walked with more
ease.&mdash;Five, morning; still felt much pain,
walked heavily, but was in good spirits.&mdash;Seven,
morning; the pain did not abate so
much at this hour as it had usually done; experienced
some difficulty in walking.&mdash;Nine,
morning; a good deal of pain; complained
on the <i>tread</i> of his foot, and walked heavily:
the ground, although turf, and watered once
every day, had become hard from the drought,
and from being trampled by so many people
who came to witness Capt. Barclay’s exertions.&mdash;Nine,
night; pain increasing; more
difficulty in walking, but in pretty good
spirits.&mdash;Eleven, evening; felt rather more
pain; somewhat stiff, but on the whole
nearly the same as during the preceding
day; lay down every time he came in from
his walk, and slept well throughout the day;
Dr. Sandiver called; recommended the application
of the warm bath, and sent a liquid in
a small phial to be rubbed on those parts
where the pain was most intense, after being
bathed, which was accordingly done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Twenty-third day.&mdash;One, morning; pain
increasing; walked with difficulty, and complained
on the soles of his feet.&mdash;Three, morning;
much worse than before; complained
of the pain in his legs and feet, and had some
difficulty in walking.&mdash;Five, morning; appeared
to have greatly recovered; was much
fresher, felt less pain, walked with more ease,
and was in good spirits.&mdash;Seven, morning;
greatly relieved from pain, and walked with
more ease.&mdash;Nine, morning; much better;
walked tolerably, and felt little pain: the
warm bath was applied, and his legs and feet
were frequently rubbed throughout the day
and night.&mdash;Nine, evening; began to feel
more pain, and more difficulty in walking;
not so well this day as yesterday; was seized
with the tooth-ach, which broke his rest, and
he was somewhat feverish; the weather very
hot.&mdash;Eleven, night; the tooth-ach still continued;
very ill and fretful; complained
much of his legs and feet, and walked with
difficulty.</p>

<p>Twenty-fourth day.&mdash;One, morning; worse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and complained much of the pain in his legs;
tooth-ach still continued; got little sleep, and
walked with more difficulty.&mdash;Three, morning;
was rather worse than last hour; had
much difficulty in walking; complained of
great pain in his legs, particularly at starting,
but was better when he had gone some distance;
distressed from want of sleep.&mdash;Five,
morning; somewhat better, and not so stiff;
walked with less difficulty; tooth-ach continued,
which deprived him of sleep.&mdash;Seven,
morning; in better spirits; the tooth-ach
abating; complained of pain in his legs
and feet.&mdash;Nine, morning; still felt much
pain, but appeared fresher; tooth-ach less
violent, and got some sleep; little variation
until evening.&mdash;Nine, evening; rather worse
than during the day; complained much of
the pain in his legs and feet, and walked with
great difficulty.&mdash;Eleven, night; pain increasing;
walked with much difficulty, but in better
spirits; tooth-ach nearly gone, and had
more sleep.</p>

<p>The warm bath had produced no good effect;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
indeed it had softened his feet so much,
that they became unable to bear the pressure
of his body, and it was therefore abandoned.
Dr. Sandiver recommended the application of
flannel soaked in boiling water, and wrung
until nearly dry, as a substitute for the bath.
The flannel in this state was applied to the
parts affected by the pain, and frequently renewed.
It had the effect to cause the pains
in his legs and thighs to remove from one part
to another, but afforded no permanent relief.</p>

<p>Twenty-fifth day.&mdash;One, morning; much
worse; great difficulty in walking, and the
pain in his legs and feet rather increased.&mdash;Three,
morning; still worse; very stiff, and
walked heavily.&mdash;Five, morning; still much
difficulty in walking, but appeared fresher.&mdash;Nine,
morning; walked with less difficulty;
appeared quite fresh, and in good spirits.
Through the day he suffered more than during
yesterday, but was in good spirits, and
ate heartily.&mdash;Nine, evening; rather more
pained, and walked with more difficulty.&mdash;Eleven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
night; pain increasing, but in tolerable
spirits; little difference in his walking.</p>

<p>Twenty-sixth day.&mdash;One, morning: very
ill and very stiff; great difficulty in walking,
and complained much of the pain.&mdash;Three,
morning: rather worse, and complained much
while walking. He was sometimes dressed
and out before he was fully awake.&mdash;Five,
morning: appeared rather better; had less
pain than last hour, and walked somewhat
easier.&mdash;Seven, morning: in good spirits, although
he suffered much while walking.&mdash;Nine,
morning: rather less pain, and walked
with less difficulty. The flannel application
began to do some good. Oil and camphor
mixed, was rubbed into the parts affected, after
the flannel had been applied.&mdash;Nine, evening:
felt more pain than through the day, and
very stiff. The flannel application eased the
pain considerably, but he was gradually becoming
weaker, and less able to bear the fatigue
of walking.&mdash;Eleven, night: complained
much of pain in his legs, and walked with
more difficulty, but in tolerable spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Twenty-seventh day.&mdash;One, morning: still
worse; great difficulty in walking, and felt
much pain.&mdash;Three, morning: at this time
very ill, and complained more of pain than at
any other time of the night and morning.&mdash;Five
and seven, morning: much better; had
less pain, and in better spirits.&mdash;Nine, morning:
more lively, and walked with less difficulty.
The flannel and oil were applied frequently
during the night and day, and the
pain moved down his legs towards his ancles.
He was on the whole rather worse this day
than during any preceding one, being very
weak, and suffering much pain.&mdash;Nine, evening:
rather worse than during the day, and
walked with difficulty.&mdash;Eleven, night: much
the same as last two hours. This day was
very rainy, and Capt. Barclay wore his great
coat, which was soon soaked, and became so
heavy as greatly to fatigue him.</p>

<p>Twenty-eighth day.&mdash;One, morning: much
pain, and very stiff.&mdash;Three, morning: complained
more than at any time through the
night, but slept well, and was sometimes dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
before his eyes were fully opened.&mdash;Five,
morning: appeared much fresher; felt less
pain, and walked with less difficulty; ate a
good breakfast as usual, and in good spirits.&mdash;Seven,
morning: somewhat better; in good
spirits, and although much pained, walked with
less difficulty.&mdash;Nine, morning: in every respect
fully as well as during two last hours.
He was rather better throughout this day than
the preceding. He always undressed, and
went to bed, when he returned from his walk,
and generally slept, by which he was much
refreshed.&mdash;Nine, evening: not so well as during
the day, and felt much pain. About this
period of the walk, it was reported in the newspapers
that Capt. Barclay’s legs were much
swelled. It was erroneous, for his legs did
not swell during the whole time.&mdash;Eleven,
night: rather worse than last hour; felt more
pain, and had more difficulty in walking.</p>

<p>Twenty-ninth day.&mdash;One, morning: pain increasing,
particularly in the calves of the legs.&mdash;Three,
morning: much worse than last
hour; complained much, and appeared very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
stiff.&mdash;Five, morning: in better spirits than
through the night, although suffering not less
pain, but walked with less difficulty.&mdash;Seven,
morning: the pain little abated; very ill at
starting, and very stiff.&mdash;Nine, morning: in
much better spirits; walked, to appearance,
with less difficulty, and recruited as the day
advanced.&mdash;Capt. Barclay always improved so
much during the day, that no person who saw
him then, had any idea of his debilitated state
during the night; and those who saw him then
were equally deceived as to his appearance
during the day. This circumstance gave occasion
to the many false reports which were
inserted in the public prints.&mdash;Nine, evening:
little difference at this time, but still felt great
pain, and was very stiff. The warm flannel
and oil were constantly applied; many prescriptions
were tried, but without effect: it is
therefore unnecessary to mention them.&mdash;Eleven,
night: nearly the same as for the last two
hours; still felt great pain; was very stiff, and
had much difficulty in walking.</p>

<p>Thirtieth day.&mdash;One, morning: not quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
so well as the last time he walked; felt more
pain, and complained much at first starting.&mdash;Three,
morning: at this time very ill;
complained of the pain in his legs alone; was
so very stiff that he could scarcely rise, and
when he got up could scarcely stand, and had
great difficulty in walking.&mdash;Five, morning:
felt as much pain as before, but appeared
fresher, and was in better spirits than during
the night and morning.&mdash;Seven, morning: in
much better spirits; walked with less difficulty,
but still felt great pain. Nine, morning;
nearly the same as last time he walked;
going on with great difficulty.&mdash;Nine, evening;
nearly the same as throughout the day,
but rather stiffer, and had more difficulty in
walking.&mdash;Eleven, night: not so well as last
time he walked; felt more pain, and very stiff,
particularly at starting, and required more
time to go the mile.</p>

<p>Thirty-first day.&mdash;One, morning: worse
than last time he walked; becoming more
stiff, and felt more pain.&mdash;Three, morning:
still more difficulty in walking; when he sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
down, could scarcely rise without assistance,
and complained much of the pain in his legs.&mdash;Five,
morning: great pain, but in good spirits.&mdash;Seven,
morning: little difference since
last time he walked, but rather better.&mdash;Nine,
morning: much the same as last time he
walked.&mdash;Eleven, morning: more difficulty in
walking than last hour; required more time,
and could scarcely mend his pace.&mdash;One, <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span>
nearly the same as last time he was out.&mdash;Three,
<span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span>: not quite so much difficulty in
walking as the last hours.&mdash;Five, afternoon:
little difference in any respect.&mdash;Nine, evening:
not so well as last walk; felt more pain,
and stiffer.&mdash;Eleven, night: if any difference,
not so well as at nine o’clock; much distressed
while walking. This day he was rather
worse than yesterday, but kept up his spirits,
and as usual enjoyed a good appetite.</p>

<p>Thirty-second day.&mdash;One, morning: now
much exhausted, and so stiff after resting
that he could not rise without assistance;
complained much of pain, and walked with
great difficulty.&mdash;Three, morning: still worse;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
when he rested, the back tendons of his legs
shrunk up, and the pain was excessive during
the time of relaxing them, but his courage was
unconquerable.&mdash;Five, morning: he now, required
so much time to walk, that he had little
time to rest, and even great part of that,
was taken up with rubbing his legs with the
oil.&mdash;Seven and nine, morning: the worst part
of the day being over, his spirits were better,
although still much pained.&mdash;Eleven, night:
the pain increasing, and experiencing great
difficulty in walking.</p>

<p>Thirty-third day.&mdash;One, morning: rather
worse; felt great pain, and could not rise up
without assistance. It required some time before
he got the use of his limbs; very stiff,
and walked with the greatest difficulty.&mdash;At
this time, he was apparently completely exhausted.&mdash;Five,
morning: not much difference
as to his walking, but in better spirits.&mdash;Seven,
morning: nearly the same as last hour.&mdash;Nine,
morning: no difference since last
time he was out; still felt great pain; could
not get up without being lifted, and kept till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
he had the use of his legs.&mdash;One, three, and
five, afternoon: continued in the same state.
Nine, evening: rather worse, and much fagged
with the rain.&mdash;Eleven, night: felt it
more difficult to walk than last time he was
out. The rain this day was very much against
him: he wore his great coat, which was soaked
every time he went out; the weight of it
distressed him, and he was becoming weaker
every hour.</p>

<p>Thirty-fourth day.&mdash;One, morning: very
ill; the pain in his legs excessive; could not
move without crying out.&mdash;Three, morning:
his worst hour; could scarcely move when
started; walked in a shuffling manner, and
could not mend his pace if it had been to save
his life.&mdash;Five, morning: not in so bad spirits
as at last walk.&mdash;Seven, morning; no difference
in walking, and in better spirits.&mdash;Nine,
morning: the same as last walk; could
not rise without assistance.&mdash;Eleven, forenoon:
somewhat better; not quite so much
difficulty in walking.&mdash;Three, five, and seven,
afternoon: little difference in any respect.&mdash;Nine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
evening: not quite so well as last time
he walked; felt more pain, and had more difficulty
in proceeding. On the whole, he was
rather better to-day than yesterday; when in
bed he felt no pain, but slept well, and readily
wakened at the call. Nothing else was yet
applied but the flannel fomentation and oil.&mdash;Eleven,
night: not so well as last time he
walked; felt more pain, and was rather heavy.</p>

<p>Thirty-fifth day.&mdash;One, morning: pain increasing,
and great difficulty in walking.&mdash;Three,
morning: his worst hour; pain excessive;
could not rise, and was lifted up. To
have seen him at this time, one would have
thought that it would be impossible for him to
go on, he was so debilitated and in such agony,
but he was determined to complete the match
at all risques.&mdash;Five, morning: in better spirits
than last time he walked; complained less,
and walked with less difficulty.&mdash;Seven, morning:
in much better spirits; did not feel so
much pain, and walked with less difficulty.&mdash;Nine,
evening: not so well as he had been
through the day, and walked more heavily.&mdash;Eleven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
night: walked with more difficulty
than last hour; complained much of the pain
in his legs; not so well this day as yesterday,
and to appearance rather more exhausted.</p>

<p>Thirty-sixth day.&mdash;One, morning: as usual
at this time, considerably worse, and walked
with great difficulty, feeling much pain.&mdash;Three,
morning: still worse, so very ill indeed,
that it became difficult to manage his
time, for he could not mend his pace, which
was now so slow that he had but little time
for rest, but he still courageously persevered.&mdash;Five,
morning: not quite so ill as at the
last walk; more cheerful, and mended his
pace.&mdash;Seven, nine, and eleven, morning:
nearly the same as at five o’clock: if any difference,
rather better.&mdash;One, <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span> no difference;
much exhausted from want of rest, but
showed no inclination to give up the match.
Three, and five, afternoon: nearly the same;
every hour becoming weaker; at this time, a
spectator would have thought it impossible for
him to go on another hour, but he persevered
contrary to all expectation.&mdash;Nine, evening:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
not quite so well as last time he walked; appeared
more distressed than during the day.&mdash;Eleven,
night: complained much of pain;
always getting weaker: if any difference, this
day rather weaker, but his appetite still the
same.</p>

<p>Thirty-seventh day.&mdash;One, morning: at this
time rather heavy and dull, but not much difference
in his walking.&mdash;Five, and seven,
morning: no difference in his walking, but in
better spirits.&mdash;Nine, morning: not quite so
well as last time he went out, the rain fagged
him.&mdash;Eleven, morning: nearly the same as
at last walk.&mdash;One, three, five, and seven,
evening: nearly in the same state.&mdash;Eleven,
night: much worse; felt excessive pain, and
walked with great difficulty; when lifted up,
could not stand for some time; every hour he
appeared weaker, and less able to proceed;
nothing could now relieve him but rest, which
he could not obtain.</p>

<p>Thirty-eighth day.&mdash;One and three, morning:
nearly in the same state as last night.&mdash;Five,
morning: somewhat better in spirits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
but had still the same difficulty in walking.&mdash;Seven,
morning: the same as at last walk, but
rather more distressed in consequence of the
rain; for at this time there was a heavy rain,
and violent thunder-storm.&mdash;Nine, morning:
the rain continued, and he was nearly the same
as at last time he walked.&mdash;Eleven, morning:
the weather warm and dry, and he walked with
less difficulty.&mdash;One, three, five, seven, and
nine, evening: little or no alteration.&mdash;Eleven,
night: not quite so well as through the
day; becoming weaker, and more distressed.
This is the first day, that any alteration could
be observed as to his eating since the commencement.
He did not seem to relish his
food so much as usual, but he never thought
of resigning the task.</p>

<p>Thirty-ninth day.&mdash;One, morning: at this
time very much wore out; had great difficulty
in walking, and complained much of the pain
in his legs.&mdash;Three, morning: still worse; the
want of rest began to affect him dreadfully;
very stiff, and could not stand, when lifted up,
without assistance.&mdash;Five, morning: in better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
but in other respects nearly the same.&mdash;Seven,
morning: in the same state.&mdash;Nine, morning,
walked with somewhat less difficulty.&mdash;Little
variation through the day.&mdash;Eleven, night:
rather worse, and weaker than yesterday.</p>

<p>Fortieth day.&mdash;One, morning: if any difference,
rather worse than last walk; more fatigued
in consequence of the rain.&mdash;Three,
morning: very ill; walked with great difficulty;
felt as much pain as ever, and much
fagged by the rain.&mdash;Five, seven, and nine:
no difference.&mdash;One, <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span>; it is now fair;
less difficulty in walking.&mdash;Eleven, evening:
becoming worse; so much worn out as to be
scarcely able to move: rather weaker this day
than yesterday.</p>

<p>Forty-first day.&mdash;One, morning: at this time
he had more difficulty to walk than ever: he
went so slowly, and so much time was required
to rub his legs, that he had little time for rest.
It was quite apparent that he could not go on
much longer.&mdash;Three, morning: fully as ill as
at last time he walked, and had quite as much
difficulty to go on.&mdash;Five, and seven: in somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
better spirits, but in other respects the
same; no difference during the day.&mdash;Nine
and eleven, night: walked with the greatest
difficulty.</p>

<p>Forty-second day.&mdash;One, morning: could
not mend his pace, but in better spirits.&mdash;Three,
morning: in better spirits than usual.
This being the last morning, there were many
attendants.&mdash;Five, seven, and nine, morning:
nearly in the same state, but in good spirits.
Eleven, forenoon: the crowd began to assemble
from all quarters.&mdash;One, <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span>; the crowd
so great that he could scarcely find room to
walk; to appearance he was much better, and
walked with less difficulty: he mended his
pace.&mdash;Three o’clock, afternoon: the last
mile, which he performed in twenty-two minutes,
and the crowd gave three cheers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before Capt. Barclay had finished the last
mile, a hot bath was prepared for him in an
adjoining house, where he slept. He was
put into the bath for a few minutes, and when
taken out, well dried with flannel, and put to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
bed. He went to bed at four o’clock, and
slept soundly till twelve, when he took some
water-gruel, and again lay down. He slept
till nine in the morning, when he got up in
perfect health, and quite relieved from pain.
He walked about Newmarket a considerable
time, and was four hours on the race-ground.&mdash;July
14th; set off for London in a chaise
and four, and arrived that evening.&mdash;15th;
walked on the streets of London in his usual
way.&mdash;16th; quite fresh, and in good spirits.&mdash;17th;
seemed as well as before he started.
This evening left London, and posted to
Ramsgate, where he joined the expedition to
Walcheren, and embarked with it as Aid-de-camp
to Lieut.-Gen. the Marquis of Huntly.</p>

<h4>TO THE READER</h4>

<p>The following Journal of this extraordinary
performance was regularly kept by the
attendants, under the inspection of a person
appointed by Mr. Webster, for the purpose of
watching the time, that his interest might be
protected in the event of any failure on the
part of Capt. Barclay. It may, therefore, be
deemed perfectly correct. In the original,
the performance of each hour is certified by
the initials of the attendant’s name, which we
do not think necessary to insert here.</p>

<p>In the first column, the hour of the morning,
day, and night, is marked; in the second,
the exact time past that hour at which he
started; in the third, the exact time at which
he returned; and in the fourth, the number
of minutes in which he walked the mile. In
the last column, the state of the weather is
mentioned; and at the foot of the page will
be found the total time of performing the
twenty-four miles, with the average of each.</p>

gradually increasing as he approached the
termination. By taking the average of the
different weeks, it appears, that he walked the

<span class="smaller">SKETCHES OF CAPT. BARCLAY’S FAVOURITE PURSUITS, AND GENERAL MODE OF LIVING.</span></h2>

<p>Robert Barclay Allardice, Esq.
of Ury, succeeded his father in the eighteenth
year of his age. He was born in the month of
August 1779, and at eight years, was sent to
England to receive his education. He remained
four years at Richmond School, and
three years at Brixton Causeway. His academical
studies were completed at Cambridge;
after which, he embarked on the great theatre
of life, under the protection of curators, who
managed his affairs, in terms of his father’s
settlement, until he arrived at the age of
twenty-one.</p>

<p>He is descended from an ancient and honourable
family<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>, and is known in the sporting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
world by the title of <span class="smcap">Captain Barclay</span>.
His favourite pursuits have ever been the art
of agriculture, as the serious business of his
life, and the manly sports, as his amusement
or recreation.</p>

<p>The improvement of his extensive estates
has occupied much of his attention, and he is
well acquainted with every thing relative to
modern husbandry. His taste for rural affairs
is hereditary, and his knowledge of them is
derived from experience. The example of his
father, who raised his rental from three hundred
pounds a year, to several thousands, was
an irresistible stimulus to an ardent mind; and
Capt. Barclay, by pursuing the plan adopted
by his immediate predecessor, has greatly augmented
the value of his property, which is still
increasing, and in a few years will produce ten
thousand pounds annually.</p>

<p>His love of the athletic exercises may proceed
from the strong conformation of his body,
and great muscular strength. But his predilection
for the manly sports has never interfered
with his important business, or in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
manner, retarded the improvement of his
estate. And what may appear difficult or impossible
to a man of ordinary frame, is to him
quite easily accomplished. His usual rate of
travelling on foot is six miles an hour, and to
walk from twenty to thirty miles before breakfast,
is a favourite amusement. To a person
so constructed by nature and habit, long journies
on foot or on horseback&mdash;the chase, or
gymnastic sports&mdash;are nothing more than that
moderate degree of exercise which is necessary
to the preservation of health.</p>

<p>His style of walking is to bend forward the
body, and to throw its weight on the knees.
His step is short, and his feet are raised only
a few inches from the ground. Any person
who will try this plan will find, that his pace
will be quickened, at the same time he will
walk with more ease to himself, and be better
able to endure the fatigue of a long
journey, than by walking in a posture perfectly
erect, which throws too much of the
weight of the body on the ancle-joints. He
always uses thick-soled shoes, and lambs-wool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
stockings, which preserve his feet from injury.
It is a good rule to shift the stockings
frequently during the performance of a long
distance; but it is indispensably requisite to
have shoes with thick soles, and so large, that
all unnecessary pressure on the feet may be
avoided.</p>

<p>Capt. Barclay’s great muscular power has
been evinced in his various pedestrian feats,
recorded in the previous Chapter; but it remains
to be noticed, that, in his arms particularly,
he possesses uncommon strength, as exemplified
in the following performances.</p>

<p>In April 1806, while in Suffolk with the 23d
regiment, although only twenty years of age,
he offered a bet of one thousand guineas,
which was not accepted, that he would lift
from the ground the weight of half a ton.
He tried the experiment, however, and having
obtained a number of weights which were fastened
together by a rope through the rings, he
lifted twenty-one half hundred weights. He
afterwards, with a straight arm, threw a half
hundred weight the distance of eight yards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and over his head the same weight, a distance
of five yards. In the mess-room, Capt. Keith,
the paymaster of the 23d regiment, who weighed
eighteen stones, stood upon Capt. Barclay’s
right hand, and, being steadied by his left, he
thus took him up and set him on the table.</p>

<p>He has performed many similar feats; and
few men are able to match him in those sports
which are analagous to the English game of
quoits, or what the ancients termed the Discus.
But the deltoid muscle of his arm is
uncommonly large, and expanded in a manner
that indicates very great strength.</p>

<p>His predecessors have always been remarkable
for their muscular power. Colonel Barclay,
the first of Ury, was upwards of six feet
in height; and his sword, which still remains,
is too heavy to be wielded “in these degenerate
days.” Many popular stories are told of
the feats of strength performed by his great-grandfather;
and the late Mr. Barclay of
Ury, it is well known, was uncommonly
powerful. The name <span class="smcap">Barclay</span> is of Celtic
origin, and implies great strength<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Capt. Barclay’s partiality to the exercise of
walking, induces him to prefer it to any other
mode of travelling; and, except when hunting,
he is seldom on horseback. While he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
carried on the improvements of his estate, as
a practical farmer, by retaining in his own
possession, and cultivating considerable tracts
of land, he frequently had occasion to go to
the Highlands of Scotland, for the purpose of
purchasing <span class="smcapuc">STOCK</span>; and in these expeditions
he always travelled on foot. He was generally
accompanied by a Mr. Molyson, who is
one of those respectable tenants who occupy
his estate. Mr. Molyson is very much skilled
in every thing relative to the value of land,
and agricultural industry, and was bred to the
profession of a farmer by the late Mr. Barclay
of Ury. He is a man of large stature, and
stands six feet three inches. He is strongly,
but proportionally and handsomely made, and
is a noted pedestrian<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Previously to Capt. Barclay’s undertaking
his astonishing performance of one thousand
miles in one thousand successive hours, he
wished an experiment tried on the same plan;
and Mr. Molyson, for a small wager, walked
one hundred and ninety-two miles in as many
successive hours. Mr. Molyson easily accomplished
the undertaking, and it was his
opinion that he could go on for six months.
But it has been now fully ascertained, by the
failure of some of the best pedestrians in England<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>,
that in attempting the <span class="smcap">Barclay match</span>,
little inconveniency is felt for the first fortnight.
It is from the fifteenth to the twentieth
day that the pedestrian begins to feel the
arduousness of the undertaking, which gradually
increases as he advances. And although
Mr. Molyson was fresh and in high spirits at
the close of the eight days, it is yet probable,
that if he had continued much longer, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
would have experienced the same difficulties
that others have done.</p>

<p>The life of a country gentleman, almost
every where, but especially in Scotland, presents
little variety, and unless he shall occupy
himself with rural affairs, or entertain a passion
for literary pursuits, he possesses no means
of relieving the vacuity of his situation, but
such as arise from field sports. Capt. Barclay,
at an early period of his life, kept a pack of
fox-hounds, with which he hunted in Kincardineshire.
But having engaged deeply in the
improvement of his estate, he renounced his
pack for more serious concerns, to which, for
several years, he wholly devoted his attention.
Having completed those measures of improvement,
however, which he had so laudably undertaken,
and his estate being brought to a
system of management that required little exertion
on his part, he entered into the service
of his country, and obtained a commission in
the 23d regiment. He went to the continent
in the year 1805, his regiment forming part of
Lord Cathcart’s army, which was sent for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
protection of Hanover. He was afterwards
promoted to a company, but was not again
employed in actual service until the unfortunate
expedition to Walcheren, where he acted
in the capacity of aid-de-camp to Lieut.-Gen.
the Marquis of Huntly. He embarked for
that pestiferous island, a few days after he had
finished his pedestrian performance at Newmarket,
and, although greatly reduced by the
fatigue of that extraordinary exertion, yet he
suffered no injury from the climate of Walcheren,
and returned home in perfect health.&mdash;Since
that period, he has not been employed
in military transactions, farther than in commanding
the local militia of his native county,
which, principally through his exertions, was
brought to a high state of discipline.</p>

<p>Five years ago, a pack of fox-hounds was
established in Kincardineshire by subscription,
under the auspices of Capt. Barclay. He regularly
attended the pack, wherever it went,
and was scarcely a day absent from the chace.
In summer, the hounds were kept at Ury, but
in the hunting season, they were for weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
stationed at Turriff in Aberdeenshire, and at
Beauchamp in the county of Angus. It was
during the residence of the establishment at
these stations, that Capt. Barclay suffered the
greatest personal inconveniency. But his ardour
for the chace is such, that he will endure
any degree of fatigue in the pursuit of his
favourite amusement.</p>

<p>During the season 1810-11, he frequently
went from Ury to Turriff, a distance of fifty-one
miles, where he arrived to breakfast. He
attended the pack to cover, often fifteen miles
from the kennel, and followed the hounds
through all the windings of the chace for
twenty or twenty-five miles farther. He returned
with the hounds to the kennel, and,
after taking refreshment, proceeded to Ury,
where he generally arrived before eleven at
night. He performed these long journies
generally twice a week, and on the average,
the distance was from one hundred and
thirty to a hundred and fifty miles, which
he accomplished in about twenty-one hours.
His reluctance to live in a country tavern,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and his anxiety to attend to his affairs at home,
were the motives which induced him to undergo
these laborious rides. When a house was
fitted up at Turriff for his accommodation during
last season, he seldom returned home after
the chace, but often left Ury in the morning
of the day in which he hunted.</p>

<p>During last winter, while the pack was stationed
at Beauchamp, he always left Ury in
the morning, and returned to dinner, after
hunting. The distance is thirty-three miles,
which, when doubled, and added to the average
distance, to the cover, and length of the
chace, was about one hundred miles. He left
Ury generally at five, morning, and returned
by five, afternoon. He performed these journies
three times a week for nine weeks, and
considered them only moderate exercise. Although
frequently drenched with rain, he seldom
shifted his clothes, experiencing no inconveniency
from wetness. To one thus inured
to fatigue, and to every change of weather,
those circumstances which would incommode
or even injure most people, are trivial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and insignificant. Capt. Barclay neither studies
the vicissitudes of the weather, nor the
changes of the season, but pursues his plans,
either as to business or amusement, with persevering
assiduity.</p>

<p>As the owner of an extensive estate, his intercourse
with the neighbouring proprietors
is frequent and friendly; and those whom
either politics or inclination lead him to associate
with, are the most respectable characters
of the county. His connection with his tenantry
is supported by all those ties which
naturally bind a proprietor to that useful
class of men. They are industrious and
thriving. They receive their farms at a fair
price; for he knows the value of the land,
and that his own interest is combined with
their prosperity. Under such circumstances,
it is to be expected that much civility will
reciprocally take place. His tenantry accordingly
participate warmly in every thing connected
with his welfare, and, in return, his
services are ever ready to promote their comfort
and happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Capt. Barclay’s mode of living is plain and
unaffected. His table is always abundantly
supplied, and he is fond of society. His hospitality
is of that frank and open kind which
sets every man at his ease. With a condescension
extremely agreeable, he directs his
attention alike to every person, and, in consistency
with the rules of good-breeding, the
perfect liberty of speech and action is enjoyed
by every one who surrounds him. He is well
acquainted with general history, the Greek
and Latin classics, and converses fluently
on most subjects that are introduced in company
as topics of discussion. He has stood
a candidate for his native county, which
his father so honourably represented in three
parliaments; and in his political sentiments
he is moderate and independent. As far from
violently censuring those whose political conduct
he does not approve, as from blindly following
the opinions of those with whom he
publicly acts or personally esteems&mdash;he thinks
for himself, and judges of measures by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
efficacy, or tries them by the legitimate deductions
of rational probability.</p>

<p>In private and in public life, Capt. Barclay
has ever evinced inflexible adherence to those
strict principles of honor and integrity which
characterise a gentleman; and, whether as
transacting with mankind, individually, or as
a public character, responsible for his opinions
and conduct at the shrine of his country, he
has always proved his sincere respect for the
rights of others, and his unfeigned attachment
to the British constitution.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">ON TRAINING.</span></h2>

<p>The art of training for athletic exercises,
consists in purifying the body and strengthening
its powers, by certain processes, which
thus qualify a person for the accomplishment
of laborious exertions. It was known to the
ancients, who paid much attention to the
means of augmenting corporeal vigour and
activity; and accordingly, among the Greeks
and Romans, certain rules of regimen and exercise
were prescribed to the candidates for
gymnastic celebrity.</p>

<p>We are not, however, in possession of any
detailed account of the particular kind of
<span class="smcap">Diet</span> in use among the Greeks previously to
the solemn contest at the public games; but
we are assured, that the strictest temperance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
sobriety, and regularity in living, were indispensably
requisite. The candidates, at the
same time, were subjected to daily exercise in
the <span class="smcap">Gymnasium</span> for ten months, which, with
the prescribed regimen, constituted the preparatory
course of training adopted by the
<span class="smcap">Athletæ</span> of ancient Greece.</p>

<p>Among the Romans, the exercises of the
<span class="smcap">Palæstra</span> degenerated from the rank of a
liberal art, and became a profession, which
was embraced only by the lowest of mankind.
The exhibitions of the <span class="smcap">Gladiators</span> were
bloody and ferocious spectacles, which evinced
the barbarous taste of the people. The
combatants, however, were regularly trained
by proper exercise, and a strict observance of
regimen. In the more early stages, their diet
consisted of dried figs, new cheese, and boiled
grain. But afterwards, animal food was introduced
as a part of the athletic regimen,
and <span class="smcapuc">PORK</span> was preferred to any other. <span class="smcap">Galen</span>
asserts, that “pork contains more real nutriment
than the flesh of any other animal which
is used as food by man: this fact,” he adds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
“is decidedly proved by the example of the
athletæ, who, if they lived but for one day on
any other kind of food, found their vigour manifestly
impaired the next<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.”</p>

<p>The preference given to pork by the ancients,
does not correspond with the practice
of modern trainers, who entirely reject it in
their regimen: But in the manner of preparing
the food they exactly agree&mdash;<span class="smcapuc">ROASTING</span> or
<span class="smcapuc">BROILING</span> being preferred to <span class="smcapuc">BOILING</span>, by both;
and bread unfermented, to that prepared by
leaven. A very small quantity of fluid was allowed,
and this was principally water. When
the daily exercises of the Athletæ were finished,
they were refreshed by immersion in a tepid
bath, “where the perspiration and sordes
were carefully removed from the surface of
the body by the use of the <span class="smcapuc">STRYGIL</span>. The
skin was then diligently rubbed dry, and again
anointed with oil. If thirsty, they were permitted
to drink a small quantity of warm water.
They then took their principal repast, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
which they never used any exercise. They
occasionally also went into the cold bath in the
morning. They were permitted to sleep as
many hours as they chose; and great increase
of vigour, as well as of bulk, was supposed to
be derived from long-continued and sound
repose<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.”</p>

<p>Previously to entering on this regimen, the
Athletæ were subjected to the evacuating process
by means of emetics, which they preferred
to purgatives. The sexual intercourse
was strictly prohibited. “To exercise their
patience, and accustom them to bear pain
without flinching, they were occasionally flogged
on the back with the branches of a kind
of <i>rhododendron</i>, till the blood flowed pretty
plentifully. By diminishing the quantity of
the circulating fluid, this rough kind of cupping
was also considered as salutary, in obviating
the tendency to plethora, to which they
were peculiarly liable<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Pure and salubrious air was deemed a chief
requisite; and accordingly the principal schools
of the Roman Athletæ were established at <span class="smcap">Capua</span>
and <span class="smcap">Ravenna</span>, the most healthy places in
all Italy. They exercised in the open air, and,
by habit, became familiarized to every change
of the weather, the vicissitudes of which soon
ceased to affect them.</p>

<p>The manner of training among the ancients
bears some resemblance to that now practised
by the moderns. But as their mode of living
and general habits were somewhat different
from those of the present age, a difference of
treatment is now required to produce the
same effects.</p>

<p>The great object of training, for running, or
boxing matches, is, to increase the muscular
strength, and to improve the free action of
the lungs, or <span class="smcapuc">WIND</span>, of the person subjected to
the process, which is done by medicines, regimen,
and exercise. That this object can be
accomplished, is evident from the nature of
the human system. It is well known, (for it
has been demonstrated by experiments,) that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
every part of the firmest bones is successively
absorbed and deposited. “The bones and
their ligaments, the muscles and their tendons,
all the finer, and all the more flexible
parts of the body, are as continually renewed,
and as properly a secretion, as the saliva that
flows from the mouth, or the moisture that
bedews the surface. The health of all the
parts, and their soundness of structure, depend
on this perpetual absorption and perpetual
renovation; and exercise, by promoting
at once absorption and secretion, promotes life
without hurrying it, renovates all the parts, and
preserves them apt and fit for every office<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.”</p>

<p>When the human frame is thus capable of
being altered and renovated, it is not surprising
that the art of training should be carried
to a degree of perfection almost incredible;
and that by certain processes, the <span class="smcapuc">BREATH</span>,
strength, and courage of man, should be so
greatly improved as to enable him to perform
the most laborious undertakings. That
such effects have been produced is unquestionable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
being fully exemplified in the astonishing
exploits of our most celebrated pedestrians,
which are the infallible results of preparatory
discipline.</p>

<p>The skilful trainer attends to the state of
the bowels, the lungs, and the skin; and he
uses such means as will reduce the fat, and at
the same time, invigorate the muscular fibres.
The patient is purged by drastic medicines;
he is sweated by walking under a load of
clothes, and by lying between feather-beds.
His limbs are roughly rubbed. His diet is
beef or mutton; his drink, strong ale; and
he is gradually inured to exercise by repeated
trials in walking and running. “By extenuating
the fat, emptying the cellular substance,
hardening the muscular fibre, and improving
the breath, a man of the ordinary frame may
be made to fight for one hour, with the utmost
exertion of strength and courage<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>,” or go
over one hundred miles in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The most effectual process for training is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
that practised by Capt. Barclay; and the particular
method which he has adopted, has not
only been <span class="smcapuc">SANCTIONED</span> by professional men,
but has met with the unqualified approbation
of amateurs. The following statement, therefore,
contains the most approved rules; and
it is presented to the reader, as the result of
much experience, founded on the theoretic
principles of the art.</p>

<p>The pedestrian who may be supposed in
tolerable condition, enters upon his training
with a regular course of physic, which
consists of three dozes. Glauber Salts are
generally preferred; and from one ounce and
a half to two ounces, are taken each time,
with an interval of four days between each
doze<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. After having gone through the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of physic, he commences his regular exercise,
which is gradually increased as he proceeds
in the training. When the object in view is
the accomplishment of a pedestrian match, his
regular exercise may be from twenty to twenty-four
miles a day. He must rise at five in the
morning, run half a mile at the top of his speed
up-hill, and then walk six miles at a moderate
pace, coming in about seven to breakfast,
which should consist of beef-steaks or mutton-chops
under-done, with stale bread and old
beer. After breakfast, he must again walk six
miles at a moderate pace, and at twelve lie
down in bed without his clothes for half an
hour. On getting up, he must walk four
miles, and return by four to dinner, which
should also be beef-steaks or mutton-chops,
with bread and beer as at breakfast. Immediately
after dinner, he must resume his exercise
by running half a mile at the top of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
speed, and walking six miles at a moderate
pace. He takes no more exercise for that
day, but retires to bed about eight, and next
morning proceeds in the same manner.</p>

<p>After having gone on in this regular course
for three or four weeks, the pedestrian must
take a four-mile <span class="smcapuc">SWEAT</span>, which is produced by
running four miles, in flannel, at the top of his
speed. Immediately on returning, a hot liquor
is prescribed, in order to promote the perspiration,
of which he must drink one English
pint. It is termed the <span class="smcapuc">SWEATING LIQUOR</span>, and
is composed of the following ingredients, viz.
one ounce of caraway-seed; half an ounce of
coriander-seed; one ounce of root liquorice;
and half an ounce of sugar-candy; mixed with
two bottles of cyder, and boiled down to one
half. He is then put to bed in his flannels,
and being covered with six or eight pairs of
blankets, and a feather-bed, must remain in
this state from twenty-five to thirty minutes,
when he is taken out and rubbed perfectly
dry. Being then well wrapt in his great coat,
he walks out gently for two miles, and returns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
to breakfast, which, on such occasions, should
consist of a roasted fowl. He afterwards proceeds
with his usual exercise. These sweats
are continued <span class="smcapuc">WEEKLY</span>, till within a few days
of the performance of the match, or, in other
words, he must undergo three or four of these
operations. If the stomach of the pedestrian
be foul, an emetic or two must be given, about
a week before the conclusion of the training,
and he is now supposed to be in the highest
condition.</p>

<p>Besides his usual or regular exercise, a person
under training, ought to employ himself
in the intervals in every kind of exertion,
which tends to activity, such as cricket, bowls,
throwing quoits, &amp;c. that, during the whole
day, both body and mind may be constantly
occupied.</p>

<p>From the above account of Capt. Barclay’s
method of training, it will be seen, that he
commences with the evacuating process, and
that three purgative dozes are deemed sufficient
to clear any man from the impurities
which it is requisite to throw off, preparatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
to entering on the course of regimen and exercise.
And in this stage of the business, the
objects to be attained, are the purification of
the animal system, and the promotion of the
digestive powers.</p>

<p>The diet or regimen is the next point of consideration,
and it is very simple. As the intention
of the trainer is to preserve the strength
of the pedestrian, he must take care to keep
him in good condition by nourishing food.
Animal diet is alone prescribed, and beef and
mutton are preferred. The lean of fat beef
cooked in steaks, with very little salt, is the
best, and it should be rather under-done than
otherwise. Mutton being reckoned easy of
digestion, may be occasionally given, to vary
the diet, and gratify the taste. The legs of
fowls are highly esteemed. It is preferable to
have the meat <span class="smcapuc">BROILED</span>, as much of its nutritive
qualities is lost by roasting or boiling<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Biscuit and stale bread are the only preparations
of vegetable matter which are permitted
to be given; and every thing inducing flatulency
must be carefully avoided. Veal and
lamb are never allowed, nor pork, which operates
as a laxative on some people; and all fat
or greasy substances are prohibited, as they
induce bile, and consequently injure the stomach.
But it has been proved by experience,
that the lean of meat contains more nourishment
than the fat, and in every case, the most
substantial food is preferable to any other kind.</p>

<p>Vegetables, such as turnips, carrots, or potatoes,
are never given, as they are watery,
and of difficult digestion. On the same principle,
fish must be avoided, and besides, they
are not sufficiently nutritious. Neither butter
nor cheese is allowed; the one being very
indigestible, and the other apt to turn rancid
on the stomach. Eggs are also forbidden, excepting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the yolk taken raw in the morning.
And it must be remarked, that salt, spiceries,
and all kinds of seasonings, with the exception
of vinegar, are prohibited.</p>

<p>With respect to liquors, they must be always
taken cold; and home-brewed beer, old, but
not bottled, is the best. A little red wine,
however, may be given to those who are not
fond of malt liquor; but never more than half
a pint after dinner. Too much liquor swells
the abdomen, and of course injures the breath.
The quantity of beer, therefore, should not
exceed three pints during the whole day, and
it must be taken with breakfast and dinner,
no supper being allowed. Water is never
given alone, and ardent spirits are strictly prohibited,
however diluted. It is an established
rule to avoid liquids as much as possible, and
no more liquor of any kind is allowed to be
taken than what is merely requisite to quench
the thirst. Milk is never allowed, as it curdles
on the stomach. Soups are not used<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
nor is any thing liquid taken warm, but gruel
or broth, to promote the operation of the physic;
and the sweating liquor mentioned above.
The broth must be cooled in order to take off
the fat, when it may be again warmed; or
beef tea may be used in the same manner,
with little or no salt. In the days between
the purges, the pedestrian must be fed as
usual, strictly adhering to the nourishing diet
by which he is invigorated.</p>

<p>Profuse sweating is resorted to as an expedient
for removing the superfluities of flesh
and fat. Three or four sweats are generally
requisite, and they may be considered the severest
part of the process.</p>

<p>Emetics are only prescribed if the stomach
be disordered, which may sometimes happen,
when due care is not taken to proportion the
quantity of food to the digestive powers. But
in general, the quantity of aliment is not limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
by the trainer, but left entirely to the
discretion of the pedestrian, whose appetite
should regulate him in this respect.</p>

<p>Although the chief parts of the training
system depend upon <span class="smcap">Sweating</span>, <span class="smcap">Exercise</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Feeding</span>, yet the object to be obtained by the
pedestrian would be defeated, if these were
not adjusted, each to the other, and to his constitution.
The skilful trainer will, therefore,
constantly study the progress of his art, by observing
the effect of the processes separately,
and in combination.</p>

<p>If a man retains his health and spirits during
the process, improves in <span class="smcapuc">WIND</span>, and increases
in strength, it is certain that the object
intended will be obtained. But if otherwise,
it is to be apprehended that some defect
exists, through the unskilfulness or mismanagement
of the trainer, which ought instantly to
be remedied by such alterations as the circumstances
of the case may demand. It is
evident, therefore, that, in many instances,
the trainer must be guided by his judgment,
and that no fixed rules of management can,
with absolute certainty, be depended upon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
for producing an invariable and determinate
result. But, in general, it may be calculated,
that the known rules are adequate to the purpose,
if the pedestrian strictly adheres to them,
and the trainer bestows a moderate degree of
attention to his state and condition during the
progress of the training.</p>

<p>It is farther necessary to remark, that the
trainer, before he proceeds to apply his theory,
should make himself acquainted with the constitution
and habits of his patient, that he may
be able to judge how far he can, with safety,
carry the different parts of the process. The
nature of his disposition should also be known,
that every cause of irritation may be avoided;
for, as it requires great patience and perseverance
to undergo training, every expedient to
soothe and encourage the mind should be
adopted.</p>

<p>It is impossible to fix a precise period for the
completion of the training process, as it depends
upon the condition of the pedestrian;
but from two to three months, in most cases,
will be sufficient, especially if he be in tolerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
condition at the commencement, and possessed
of sufficient perseverance and courage
to submit cheerfully to the privations and
hardships to which he must unavoidably be
subjected.</p>

<p>Training is indispensably necessary to those
who are to engage in corporeal exertions beyond
their ordinary powers. Pedestrians,
therefore, who are matched either against
others or against time; and pugilists, who engage
to fight; must undergo the training process
before they contend, as the issue of the
contest, if their powers be nearly equal, will,
in a great measure, depend upon their relative
condition. But the advantages of the training
system are not confined to pedestrians and
pugilists alone. They extend to every man;
and were training generally introduced, instead
of medicines, as an expedient for the
prevention and cure of diseases, its beneficial
consequences would promote his happiness,
and prolong his life.</p>

<p>It is well known to physiologists, that both
the solids and fluids which compose the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
frame are successively absorbed and deposited.
Hence a perpetual renovation of the
parts ensues, regulated, as they are, by the
nature of our food and general habits<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. It,
therefore, follows, that our health, vigour, and
activity, must depend upon regimen and exercise,
or, in other words, upon the observance
of those rules which constitute the theory
of the training process. The effect has
accordingly corresponded with the cause in
all instances where training has been adopted;
and, although not commonly resorted to as
the means of restoring invalids to health, yet
there is every reason to believe, that it would
prove effectual in curing many obstinate diseases,
such as the gout, rheumatism, bilious
complaints, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>“Training (says Mr. Jackson,) always appears
to improve the state of the lungs. One
of the most striking effects is to improve the
wind; that is, it enables a man to draw a larger
inspiration, and to hold his breath longer.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
He farther observes,&mdash;“By training, the mental
faculties are also improved. The attention
is more ready, and the perception more
acute, probably owing to the clearness of the
stomach, and better digestion<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.”</p>

<p>It has been made a question whether training
produces a <i>lasting</i>, or only a <i>temporary</i> effect
on the constitution. It is undeniable,
that if a man be brought to a better condition;
if corpulency, and the impurities of his
body, disappear; and if his <i>wind</i> and strength
be improved by any process whatever, his
good state of health will continue, until some
derangement of his frame shall take place
from accidental or natural causes. If he
shall relapse into intemperance, or neglect
the means of preserving his health, either by
omitting to take the necessary exercise, or
by indulging in debilitating propensities, he
must expect such encroachments to be made
on his constitution, as must soon unhinge his
system. But if he shall observe a different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
plan, the beneficial effects of the training process
will remain until the gradual decay of his
natural functions shall, in mature old age, intimate
the approach of his dissolution.</p>

<p>The ancients entertained this opinion.&mdash;“They
were,” says Dr. Buchan, “by no
means unacquainted with, or inattentive to,
these instruments of medicine, although modern
practitioners appear to have no idea of
removing disease, or restoring health, but by
pouring drugs into the stomach. <span class="smcap">Herodicus</span>
is said to have been the first who applied the
exercises and regimen of the gymnasium to
the removal of disease, or the maintenance of
health. Among the Romans, <span class="smcap">Asclepiades</span>
carried this so far, that he is said by <span class="smcap">Celsus</span>
almost to have banished the use of internal
remedies from his practice. He was the inventor
of pensile beds, which were used to
induce sleep, and of various other modes of
exercise and gestation, and rose to great eminence
as a physician in Rome. In his own
person he afforded an excellent example of
the wisdom of his rules, and the propriety of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
his regimen. <span class="smcap">Pliny</span> tells us that, in early life,
he made a public profession that he would
agree to forfeit all pretensions to the name of
a physician, should he ever suffer from sickness,
or die but of old age; and, what is more
extraordinary, he fulfilled his promise, for he
lived upwards of a century, and at last was
killed by a fall down stairs<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.”</p>

<p>It may therefore be admitted, that the beneficial
consequences, both to the body and
the mind, arising from training, are not merely
temporary, but may be made permanent by
proper care and attention. The simplicity of
the rules is a great recommendation to those
who may be desirous of trying the experiment,
and the whole process may be resolved into
the following principles: 1st, The <i>evacuating</i>,
which cleanses the stomach and intestines.&mdash;2d,
The <i>sweating</i>, which takes off the superfluities
of flesh and fat.&mdash;3d, The <i>daily course
of exercise</i>, which improves the <i>wind</i>, and
strengthens the muscles;&mdash;and, lastly, The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
<i>regimen</i>, which nourishes and invigorates the
body.</p>

<p>The criterion by which it may be known
whether a man be in good condition, or, what
is the same thing, has been properly trained,
is the state of the skin, which becomes <i>smooth</i>,
<i>elastic</i>, and <i>well-coloured</i>, or <i>transparent</i>.&mdash;The
flesh is also <i>firm</i>, and the person trained,
feels himself light, and full of spirits. But in
the progress of the training, his condition may
be ascertained by the effect of the <i>sweats</i>,
which cease to reduce his weight; and by the
manner in which he performs one mile at the
top of his speed. It is as difficult to run a
mile at the top of one’s speed, as to walk a
hundred, and therefore, if he performs this
short distance well, it may be concluded, that
his condition is perfect, or that he has derived
all the advantages which can possibly result
from the training process.</p>

<p>The manner of training <i>jockies</i> is different
from that which is applicable to pedestrians
and pugilists. In regard to jockies, it is generally
<i>wasting</i>, with the view to reduce their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
weight. This is produced by purgatives, emetics,
sweats, and starvation. Their bodily
strength is of no importance, as they have
only to manage the reins of the courser, whose
fleetness depends upon the weight he carries;
and the muscular power of the rider is of no
consequence to the race, provided it be equal
to the fatigue of a three or four-mile heat.</p>

<p>Training for pugilism is nearly the same as
for pedestrianism, the object in both being
principally to obtain additional <i>wind</i> and
strength.&mdash;But it will be best illustrated by a
detail of the process observed by <span class="smcap">Crib</span>, the
champion of England, preparatory to his
grand battle with Molineaux, which took
place on the 29th of September 1811.</p>

<p>The champion arrived at Ury on the 7th
of July of that year. He weighed sixteen
stones; and from his mode of living in London,
and the confinement of a crowded city,
he had become corpulent, big-bellied, full of
gross humours, and short-breathed; and it
was with difficulty he could walk ten miles.
He first went through a course of physic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
which consisted of three dozes; but for two
weeks he walked about as he pleased, and
generally traversed the woods and plantations
with a fowling-piece in his hand. The <i>reports</i>
of his musquet resounded everywhere through
the groves and the hollows of that delightful
place, to the great <i>terror</i> of the magpies and
wood-pigeons.</p>

<p>After amusing himself in this way for about
a fortnight, he then commenced his regular
walking exercise, which at first was about ten
or twelve miles a day. It was soon after increased
to eighteen or twenty; and he ran
regularly, morning and evening, a quarter of
a mile at the top of his speed. In consequence
of his physic and exercise, his weight
was reduced, in the course of five weeks, from
sixteen stones to fourteen and nine pounds.
At this period, he commenced his <i>sweats</i>, and
took three during the month he remained at
Ury afterwards; and his weight was gradually
reduced to thirteen stones and five pounds,
which was ascertained to be his <i>pitch</i> of condition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
as he would not reduce farther without
weakening.</p>

<p>During the course of his training, the champion
went twice to the Highlands, and took
strong exercise. He walked to <span class="smcap">Mar Lodge</span>,
which is about sixty miles distant from Ury,
where he arrived to dinner on the second day,
being now able to go thirty miles a day with
ease, and probably he could have walked twice
as far if it had been necessary. He remained
in the Highlands about a week each time, and
amused himself with shooting. The principal
advantage which he derived from these expeditions
was the severe exercise he was obliged
to undergo in following Capt. Barclay. He
improved more in strength and wind by his
journies to the Highlands than by any other
part of the training process.</p>

<p>His diet and drink were the same as used
in the pedestrian regimen, and in other respects,
the rules previously laid down were generally
applied to him. That he was brought
to his ultimate <i>pitch</i> of condition, was evident
from the high state of health and strength in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
which he appeared when he mounted the
stage to contend with Molineaux, who has
since confessed, that when he saw his fine
condition, he totally despaired of gaining the
battle.</p>

<p>Crib was altogether about eleven weeks
under training, but he remained only nine
weeks at Ury. Besides his regular exercise,
he was occasionally employed in sparring at
Stonehaven, where he gave lessons in the pugilistic
art. He was not allowed much rest,
but was constantly occupied in some active
employment. He enjoyed good spirits, being
all the time fully convinced that he would
beat his antagonist. He was managed, however,
with great address, and the result corresponded
with the wishes of his friends.</p>

<p>It would be perhaps improper, while speaking
of Crib, to omit mentioning, that, during
his residence in the north of Scotland, he conducted
himself in all respects with much propriety.
He shewed traits of a feeling, humane,
and charitable disposition, on various
occasions.&mdash;While walking along Union-street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
in Aberdeen, he was accosted by a woman apparently
in great distress. Her story affected
him, and the emotions of his heart became
evident in the muscles of his face. He gave
her all the silver he had in his pocket.&mdash;“God
bless your Honor,” she said, “<i>ye are surely
not an ordinary man!</i>”&mdash;This circumstance is
mentioned with the more pleasure, as it affords
one instance at least, in opposition to the
mistaken opinion, that professional pugilists are
ferocious, and totally destitute of the better
propensities of mankind. The illustrious Mr.
Windham entertained juster sentiments of the
pugilistic art, as evinced by the print he presented
to Mr. Jackson as a mark of his esteem.
In one compartment, an <i>Italian</i> darting his
stiletto at his victim is represented; and in
the other, the combat of two <i>Englishmen</i> in a
ring. For this celebrated genius was always
of opinion, that nothing tended more to preserve
among the English peasantry those sentiments
of good faith and honour which have
ever distinguished them from the natives of
Italy and Spain, than the frequent practice of
fair and open <span class="smcap">Boxing</span>.</p>

<span class="smaller">ON THE PHYSICAL POWERS OF MAN.</span></h2>

<p>The mechanical construction of <span class="smcapuc">MAN</span> is admirably
adapted to his destination. His body
is neither too large nor too small; but of that
convenient size which fits him for the station
in which he is placed. Were it larger, his activity,
and even his strength in proportion to
his bulk, would be diminished; and he would
thus be deprived of many of those enjoyments
which contribute so much to his happiness.&mdash;He
would lose the services of some of the most
useful of the inferior animals; especially those
of the Horse, whose power is limited to a degree
of strength not much exceeding the carriage
of the weight of a man. On the other
hand, a diminutive race could neither accomplish
those great undertakings which are required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
for their comfort, nor, perhaps, be
able to maintain the dominion of the earth
against the beast of the forest. But man
enjoys every advantage which can be derived
from the exact adjustment of his capacity
to his duty; and if he be “fearfully and wonderfully
made,” it is in perfect consistency
with that wisdom which is displayed in all the
works of nature.</p>

<p>As, in this world, man has been placed in the
first rank of created beings, his mental powers
are not only incomparably beyond those
of other animals, but his physical strength also
exceeds that of most of them. An ingenious
Frenchman ascertained the strength of the
human frame, by placing on every part of a
man’s body, standing upright, a number of
weights in such a manner, that each part supported
as much as it could bear relatively to
the rest; and it was found by this contrivance,
that a man could stand under two thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>The bulk of the body of a horse is to that
of a man as six or seven are to one; so that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
if his strength were proportionate to that of
our species, he ought to bear a load of twelve
or fourteen thousand pounds; but no horse
could carry such a weight; and his strength,
therefore, allowing for the difference of size,
is not equal to that of man.</p>

<p>In a memoir presented to the National Institute
of France, M. Coulomb suggested the
idea of ascertaining the quantity of daily action
which men are able to furnish by individual labour,
according to the different modes in which
they employ their strength. And it has been
said that, if all the strength a man could exert
in a day, were united into a single effort, he
could lift (one foot from the ground,) a weight
equal to one million seven hundred and twenty-eight
thousand pounds, without injuring himself.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Dynanometer</span>, of <i>M. Regnier</i>, has afforded
some curious results regarding the
strength of the people of different nations.
In the years 1800-1-2-3, and 4, M. Peron
sailed on a voyage of discovery with Captains
<i>Baudin</i> and <i>Hamelin</i>, in the French ships <i>Le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Geographe</i>, and <i>Le Naturaliste</i>; and in the
first volume of his <i>Voyage de Decouvertes aux
Terres Australes</i>, he gives an account of some
experiments he made with this new instrument
to ascertain the comparative strength which
individuals are capable of exerting.</p>

<p>According to the Dynanometer, M. Peron
found, that the inhabitants of the countries
under-mentioned, were capable of exerting a
force as follows, viz.</p>

<p>From the above experiments it appears,
that men in a savage state, are not so strong
as those under the influence of civilization;
“and thus it is demonstrated, that the improvement
of social order does not impair our
physical powers, as some persons have imagined.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
And it is also evident, that Englishmen
possess more strength than Frenchmen;
a fact that has been proved as often as our
soldiers have charged the French army with
the bayonet.</p>

<p>The strength and activity of the human
frame arise from the muscular conformation
of its parts, and their constant <span class="smcapuc">EXERCISE</span>.&mdash;Those
habituated to carry burdens will bear
a load of from six to eight hundred pounds;
while other men, of the same weight and apparent
strength, would find it difficult to carry
more than one hundred and fifty, to two hundred
pounds. This difference is the effect of
practice; as nature proportionally augments
the power of those parts of the body which
are most exerted.</p>

<p>From the same cause, watermen, fishermen,
and sailors, who are accustomed to the use of
the oar, acquire great strength in their arms;
but, indeed, the position of the rower is the
best calculated of any, for exerting and increasing
the muscular power of the body, as
every part must be employed at the same time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Accordingly, that hardy race of men whose
occupation leads them to ply the oar on our
rivers, and along the sea coast, are the strongest
and most robust of our species.</p>

<p>Pedestrianism also depends on practice;
for the citizen, whose excursions are limited
to six or seven miles on a holiday, would be
as much fatigued by a walk of double that
distance, as a person in the country who is
accustomed to travel, would be, by the accomplishment
of a journey of fifty or sixty miles.
Such is the nature of our physical and intellectual
faculties, that they can be improved
only by calling them into action, or what is
the same thing, they can only be invigorated
by the resistance they offer to the pressure of
difficulties, and acquire power, therefore, in
proportion to the obstacles which they have to
overcome.</p>

<p>The strength and activity of men who are
inured to the exercise of walking, are truly
astonishing. They will travel farther for a
week or a month than a horse, and, if habituated
to hunting, they will outrun him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
continue the chace much longer. The American
Indians, it is said by travellers, pursue
the elk with such rapidity, that they are able to
fatigue and secure him, although he is as swift
as the stag. It is also related of those men, that
they will go journies of a thousand leagues in
six weeks or two months; or at the rate of about
sixty miles a day, over the most rugged
mountains, and through tractless countries.</p>

<p>But feats more astonishing than those performed
by the Indians, or any other nation,
have been accomplished of late years in Britain.
Captain Barclay walked one hundred
and ten miles in nineteen hours and twenty-seven
minutes; and Glanville went a hundred
and forty-two miles in twenty-nine hours. In
the pages of this volume, we have recorded
many examples of the almost incredible
strength, agility, and perseverance of modern
pedestrians. And as <span class="smcapuc">EXERCISE</span>, particularly
on foot, is attended by so many advantages to
mankind, the Author thinks, he cannot conclude
this work with any observations more
apposite to the subject than those of the amiable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Christopher Christian Sturm</span>. “Man,
(says he,) in a state of civilization, does not
know how much strength he possesses; how
much he loses by effeminacy, nor how much
he can acquire by frequent exercise. We cannot
but regard with pity those indolent beings,
who pass their lives in idleness and effeminacy;
who never exert their strength, nor exercise
their powers, for fear of injuring their health,
or shortening their lives.”</p>

<p>“Let us, in future, therefore, exert all our
powers and faculties for the good of our fellow
creatures, according to our situation and
circumstances; and, if necessity require, let
us cheerfully earn our bread by the sweat of
our brow; even then our happiness is greater
than that of thousands of our fellow men;”
and “the more happy we find our lot compared
with [that of] the unfortunate victims
of <span class="smcapuc">LUXURY</span>, the more seriously ought we to
apply ourselves to fulfil our duties.”&mdash;<i>Sturm’s

GENEALOGY OF THE FAMILY OF BARCLAY OF
MATHERS AND URY, IN THE COUNTY OF MEARNS.</span></h2>

<p>Robert Barclay Allardice, Esq. of Ury, in
Kincardineshire, is descended from an ancient and honourable
family. We can trace his progenitors so far back as to
the third year of the reign of Alexander I. son to Malcolm
III. king of Scotland; and the tenth of Henry I. son to
William the Conqueror; or, to the year 1110.</p>

<p>In the time of William the Lion, there were four eminent
persons in Scotland, of the name of <i>Berkeley</i>, or <i>Berkelai</i>,
sprung from the same stock, and united by consanguinity,
viz. <i>Walter</i>, <i>William</i>, <i>Humphrey</i>, and <i>Robert</i>. The
two first were great chamberlains of the kingdom. <i>Walter</i>
is so designed in a donation granted by him to the monks
of <i>Aberbrothwick</i>, of the church of <i>Innerkelder</i>, in the county
of Angus, which is confirmed by William the Lion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
still preserved in the Advocates’ Library of Edinburgh, and
also in the <i>Charter of Aberdeen</i>, which remains in perfect
preservation in the Record Office of that city. <i>William</i> is
likewise designed chamberlain, in a deed granted by the
king to the monks of the <i>Cistertian</i> order, which is copied
from the original by <i>Anderson</i>, in his <i>Independency</i> of Scotland.</p>

<p>Walter de Berkeley was one of the pledges for William
the Lion, to Henry the Second of England, as mentioned
in Abercrombie’s history. He was appointed chamberlain
in 1165, and was one of those who returned to Scotland
with William, about the close of the year 1174<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. Walter
left two daughters only, one of whom, according to Nicols’
Peerage, was married to <i>Seten</i> of <i>Seton</i>, the predecessor of
the Earl of <i>Winton</i>.</p>

<p>From these circumstances, it is a natural deduction, that
the Berkeley family must have been settled in Scotland
long previously to this period. They enjoyed the confidence
of the king, and held the highest offices in the state,
which would not probably have been the case with men
of low extraction, or who had recently emerged from obscurity.</p>

<p>But it appears by charters of confirmation from William
the Lion, that Walter de Berkeley of Innerkelder, was cotemporary
with, and cousin-german to, Humphrey, the son
of <i>Theobald de Berkeley</i>, the original of the family of <i>Mathers</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
in the county of Kincardine. Theobald lived in the
time of Alexander the First, and David the First, kings of
Scotland, having been born about the year 1110; and he
had two sons, Humphrey and John. Humphrey, being in
possession of a large domain in the county of Kincardine,
granted a donation to the abbot and monks of Aberbrothwick,
from the lands of <i>Balfeith</i>, <i>Monboddo</i>, <i>Glenfarquhar</i>,
&amp;c. which is witnessed by <i>Willielmo et Waltero Capellanis
dom. regis, Willielmo Cummin, Willielmo Gifford, Phillipo de
Moubray, Dom. de Arbuthenot, Phillipo de Mallevill, Johanne
de Monfort, Waltero Scot, et Waltero filio suo, Agatha sponsa
mea, cum multis aliis</i>. This donation was confirmed by
William the Lion, before these witnesses: <i>Waltero et Willielmo
Capellanis nostris, Will. Cummin, Phillipo de Moubray,
Roberto de Lunden, Roberto de Berkeley, cum multis aliis;
apud Forfar, XXVI. Martii</i>.</p>

<p>Humphrey’s donation was renewed and augmented by
<i>Richenda</i>, his only child and daughter, with consent of her
husband, <i>Robert</i>, the son of <i>Warnebald</i>, ancestor to the Earl of
<i>Glencairn</i>. The witnesses to this deed were, <i>Dom. J. Wishart,
vicesm. de Mernis, et Johanne filio ejus; Dom. Duncano de
Arbuthenot, et filio ejus; Humphreo de Middleton, cum multis
aliis</i>. This second grant was confirmed by Alexander II.;
the witnesses being <i>A. Abbato de Melross, Ro. Abbato de Newbottle,
Tho. de Hay, Alex. de Seton, cum multis aliis, vicesimo
die Martii, anno regni nostri, vicesimo quarto</i>. After the death
of Robert the son of Warnebald, the monks prevailed on
his widow, Richenda, to dispone these lands to them for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
third time; <i>et ad majus hujus rei testimonium, in posterum
una cum sigillo meo huic scripto, sigillum venerab. patris nostri
R. Abredonensis episc. et sigillum Domini Anselm Cammel feci

de Moubray, Dom. Roberto de Montealto, et Dom. Will. de
Hunyter, cum multis aliis</i>. This third deed was confirmed
by Alexander II. at Aberbrothwick, the 7th March, (anno
1236,) and thirty-second year of his reign. <i>Coram test.
venerab. patr. Ro. Epis. Abre; Willielmo Comite de Marr,
Waltero de Moravii, R. de Montealto</i>.</p>

<p>These six documents, viz. the three donations, and the
three respective confirmations, were extracted from the
Chartulary of Aberbrothwick, which still remains in the
Advocates’ Library of Edinburgh, and they may, therefore,
be deemed quite authentic.</p>

<p><i>Humphrey</i>, and his daughter <i>Richenda</i>, having died without
male issue, <i>John de Berkeley</i>, the brother of Humphrey,
succeeded, and, being dissatisfied with the alienations they
had made, he turned the abbot and monks out of all their
possessions in his domains. But he was obliged to compromise
the matter with them; and, with the concurrence
of his heir <i>Robert</i>, he gave them the mill of <i>Conveth</i>, with
its appurtenances, in <i>lieu</i> of the lands of which he dispossessed
them, burdened, however, with the yearly payment
of thirteen merks of silver to him and his heirs.</p>

<p>This agreement was not only signed and sealed by the
abbot and monks of Aberbrothwick; by John, and his heir,
Robert de Berkeley; but also, <i>una cum sigillis vener. virorum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>

by King Alexander II.; <i>coram test. Greg. Episco. Brechin,
Willielmo de Bosco, nostro cancellario; Ro. de Lunden, nostro
fratre; Hugo Cameron, cum multis aliis</i>. These deeds have
been preserved in the Chartulary of Aberbrothwick, from
which they were extracted; and they sufficiently establish,
that <i>Theobald</i>, <i>Humphrey</i>, and <i>John</i>, must have lived in the
time of <i>Alexander I.</i> <i>David I.</i> <i>Malcolm IV.</i> <i>William the
Lion</i>, and <i>Alexander II.</i> kings of Scotland, who were cotemporary
with <i>Henry I.</i>, <i>Stephen</i>, <i>Henry II.</i> the first of the
Plantagenets; <i>Richard I.</i> and <i>John</i>, kings of England.&mdash;Upon
the demise of <i>John</i>, the son of Humphrey, he was succeeded
by his son,</p>

<p>(3.) <i>Robert de Berkeley</i>, who, as it is already observed,
consented to the agreement between his father, and the abbot
and monks of Aberbrothwick. He was succeeded by
his son,</p>

<p>(4.) <i>Hugh de Berkeley</i>, who obtained a charter from King
<i>Robert Bruce</i>, upon <i>Westerton</i>, being lands lying near the
mill of <i>Conveth</i>, in Kincardineshire.</p>

<p>(5.) <i>Alexander de Berkeley</i> succeeded his father, <i>Hugh</i>, and
to the paternal estates added <i>Mathers</i>, in consequence of his
marrying <i>Catharine</i>, sister to <i>William de Keith</i>, marischal of
Scotland, as vouched by a charter, dated anno 1351, granted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
by <i>William de Keith</i>, “with consent (as the deed expresses
it) of <i>Margaret</i>, my wife, to <i>Alexander de Berkeley</i>, and
<i>Catharine</i>, my sister, his spouse, and the longest liver of
them two, and the heirs male of their bodies, my lands of

<i>David Bruce</i>, at Perth, the 18th of March, and twenty-first
of his reign: <i>coram test. Roberto seneschallo, nepote nostro</i>,
(the first king of Scotland of the Stewart race,) <i>Tho. Seneschal,

<p>The original charter from William de Keith, and the confirmation
by David Bruce, are both in the possession of Mr.
Barclay of Ury.</p>

<p>(6.) <i>David de Berkeley</i>, 2d of <i>Mathers</i>, succeeded to his
father <i>Alexander</i>; and he married the daughter of <i>John de
Seton</i>, who witnessed the above charter from William de
Keith. His son,</p>

<p>(7.) <i>Alexander de Berkeley</i>, 3d of <i>Mathers</i>, was his successor,
and he married <i>Helen</i>, the daughter of <i>Græme</i> of Morphy.
Their son,</p>

<p>(8.) <i>David de Berkeley</i>, 4th of <i>Mathers</i>, succeeding,
built the castle, called the <i>Keim</i> of <i>Mathers</i>. He married
<i>Elisabeth</i>, the daughter of <i>Strachan</i> of <i>Thornton</i>, then an ancient
and flourishing family in the <i>Mearns</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>(9.) <i>Alexander Barclay</i>, 5th of <i>Mathers</i>, succeeded his
father, <i>David de Berkeley</i>: and he was the first of the family
who spelled the name as it is done at present. He
married <i>Catharine Wishart</i>, the daughter of <i>Wishart</i> of <i>Pitarrow</i>,
and was succeeded by his son,</p>

<p>(10.) <i>David Barclay</i>, 6th of <i>Mathers</i>, who married <i>Janet</i>,
daughter of <i>Irvine</i> of <i>Drum</i>, then one of the most considerable
families in the shire of Aberdeen. His eldest son was</p>

<p>(11.) <i>Alexander Barclay</i>, 7th of <i>Mathers</i>, who married
<i>Marjory</i>, daughter of <i>James Auchinleck</i> of <i>Glenbervie</i>. Auchinleck
obtained the estate of Glenbervie, by marrying the
daughter of <i>Melvil</i>, the proprietor, who was sheriff of the
Mearns, and murdered by the barons. James Auchinleck
had two daughters, but no male heir; and the elder was
married to <i>Sir William Douglas</i>, the second son of the famous
Earl of <i>Angus</i>, called <i>Bell the Cat</i>. By this marriage, the
Douglasses got the estate of Glenbervie.</p>

<p>Alexander Barclay sold the lands of <i>Slains</i> and <i>Falside</i> in
the Mearns, to <i>Andrew Moncur</i> of <i>Knapp</i>, to whom he
granted a charter to be held of himself and his heirs, dated
anno 1497. He also granted a precept of <i>Clare constat.</i> to
<i>Sir James Ogilvie</i> of <i>Deskford</i>, predecessor to the Earl of
<i>Findlater</i>, for infesting him in the lands of <i>Durn</i>, of which
he was superior. This precept bears date the 29th April
1510, at <i>Kirktonhill</i>, which was then the principal seat of
the family of Mathers. <i>Alexander</i> was succeeded by his
son,</p>

<p>(12.) <i>George Barclay</i>, 8th of <i>Mathers</i>, who married <i>Marjory</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
daughter of <i>Sir James Auchterlony</i>, of <i>Auckterlony</i> and
<i>Kellie</i>, then a considerable family in the shire of <i>Angus</i>.&mdash;His
son’s name was,</p>

<p>(13.) <i>David Barclay</i>, 9th of <i>Mathers</i>, who married first
<i>Mary</i>, daughter to <i>Rait</i> of <i>Halgreen</i>, by whom he had
<i>George</i>, who succeeded him. He married for his second
wife, <i>Catharine Home</i>, and had by her a son named <i>John</i>,
to whom he gave the lands of <i>Johnston</i> in the Mearns, as
established by Barclay of Johnston’s first charter, dated
anno 1560. <i>Barclay</i> of <i>Balmaquean</i> is a cadet of the Johnston
family. David Barclay was succeeded by his first son,</p>

<p>(14.) <i>George Barclay</i>, 10th of <i>Mathers</i>, who married <i>Mary
Erskine</i>, daughter to <i>Sir Thomas Erskine</i> of <i>Brechin</i>, secretary
of state to <i>James V.</i> of Scotland. He married for his
second wife, <i>Margaret</i>, daughter to <i>Wood</i> of <i>Bonnington</i> in
<i>Angus</i>, afterwards baronets, and now represented by James
Wood, Esq. of Woodburnden, in the county of the Mearns;
and by her he had a son, to whom he gave the lands of
<i>Bridgeton</i> and <i>Jackstown</i>, in the <i>Mearns</i>. His first son succeeded
to the estate, and his name was</p>

<p>(15.) <i>Thomas Barclay</i>, 11th of <i>Mathers</i>, who married
<i>Janet</i>, daughter to <i>Straiton</i> of <i>Lauristown</i> in the <i>Mearns</i>, a
very ancient and honourable family. Thomas Barclay died
before his father, leaving only one son,</p>

<p>(16.) <i>David Barclay</i>, 12th of <i>Mathers</i>, who was born anno
1580. He was polite and accomplished, and lived much
at Court; but a taste for show and extravagance, led him
to indulge in every fashionable expense, by which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
greatly impaired his property, and he sold five valuable estates.
He was twice married: first, to <i>Elizabeth</i>, the daughter
of <i>Livingston</i> of <i>Dunnipace</i>, by whom he had five sons
and a daughter; second, to <i>Margaret Keith</i>, grand-child to
Earl Marischal. To his daughter he gave a handsome fortune,
and to his sons a liberal education. The two eldest
died when young: <i>David</i>, the third son, became eminently
conspicuous: <i>Robert</i>, the fourth, was rector of the Scots
College at Paris; and <i>James</i>, the youngest, was a captain
of horse, and was killed at the battle of Philiphaugh, on
the 13th September 1645, where he gallantly signalized
himself.</p>

<p>(17.) <i>Colonel David Barclay</i>, the first of <i>Ury</i>, and third
son of <i>David</i> of <i>Mathers</i>, was born at <i>Kirktonhill</i> in the
county of Kincardine, in the year 1610. After being instructed
in every accomplishment of the age, he went to
Germany, and entered a volunteer in the Swedish service,
under the great Gustavus Adolphus. His manly and elegant
appearance soon attracted the attention of his majesty,
and he acquired a high reputation for courage and bravery.
He merited and obtained the distinguished favour of Adolphus.
But his fame as an active and experienced soldier
having reached his native country, he was pressingly solicited
by his friends to return home to take a part in the
civil wars with which Scotland was then distracted.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in the year 1646, as a proof of his character
and high merit, we find him colonel of a regiment of
horse, and at the head of an army quelling an insurrection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
raised by the Earl of Crawford, who, with a number of
Scots and Irish troops had burned several towns, and ravaged
the northern parts of the kingdom. The colonel
came up with the earl at Banff, entirely routed him, and
committed great slaughter among the Irish, who had perpetrated
many acts of wanton barbarity throughout the
country. In the same year, General Middleton and the
colonel were sent with an army to relieve the town of Inverness,
at that time besieged by the renowned Marquis of
Montrose, and Earl Seaforth. Colonel Barclay, at the head
of his regiment, forced the ford of the river Ness, where
the enemy was strongly posted; and, being well supported
by Middleton, attacked and drove them to the mountains,
taking all their cannon and baggage. Inverness being thus
relieved, the army retired to the south country; but the
Marquis of Huntly taking advantage of its absence, attacked
the town of Aberdeen, and became master of it, although
bravely defended by the citizens and two regiments
under the command of <i>Colonel Harry Barclay</i>, a relative
of Colonel David’s, who was taken prisoner, with
twenty of his officers. To dispossess Huntly, the parliament,
in April 1647, sent Middleton and the colonel again
to the north; but the marquis did not think proper to wait
their approach, and hastily retreated to the Highlands. To
prevent his return, however, they took possession of his
strong holds, in which they placed garrisons. Colonel
Barclay was appointed governor of Strathbogie and Middleton,
of the Bog of Gight, now <i>Castle Gordon</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>In the following year, the colonel found leisure to attend
to his domestic concerns, and married <i>Catharine</i>, eldest
daughter of <i>Sir Robert Gordon</i> of <i>Gordonston</i>, who was second
son of the Earl of Sutherland, by Jane, daughter of
the Marquis of Huntly. Sir Robert Gordon was cousin to
King James the Sixth of Scotland, by his grandmother,
Lady Helen Stewart, his majesty’s grand-aunt; and being
a man of great parts, was highly esteemed at Court. As
the different estates which formerly belonged to the Barclays
of Mathers, were now nearly all disposed of by the
colonel’s father, he entered into a contract with Earl Marischal
for the barony of <span class="smcap">Ury</span>, where he fixed the future residence
of the family, which has since been designed by
the name of that property.</p>

<p>Colonel Barclay being an active and experienced officer,
and perfectly devoted to the cause in which he had engaged,
was appointed to command in the shires of Ross,
Sutherland, and Caithness. The nation at that time was
much interested in the fate of Charles I.; and the parliament
of Scotland sent an army to his assistance in England,
under the Duke of Hamilton; and the internal protection
of the kingdom was committed to the Earl of Lanark, the
<i>laird</i> of Gartland, and Colonel Barclay. The whole country
to the north of the Tay, including the town of Perth, was
placed under the colonel’s authority; and he executed this
important commission with vigour and fidelity. But the
Duke of Hamilton’s overthrow at Preston, destroyed the
hopes of his friends; and the opposite party gaining the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
ascendancy, through Cromwell’s means, Colonel Barclay,
and many other officers, were deprived of their commands.</p>

<p>From this time, it appears that the colonel laid aside his
military character, and lived for several years in retirement
at Gordonston, in Morayshire, the seat of his father-in law.
But his friend, Earl Marischal, having been taken prisoner
by General Monk at Elliot in Angus, and his estates seized,
the barony of Ury was included in the forfeiture, on the
pretence that it was not fully conveyed by the earl. Colonel
Barclay was advised to obtain a seat in the Scots parliament,
which would afford him the only means of recovering
his property. He was accordingly elected for Sutherlandshire,
through the interest of his cousin, the Earl of
Sutherland; but he was returned to the next parliament
by the counties of Angus and Mearns, through his own influence.
He became so popular indeed, by his services, to
the nobility and gentry of these districts, that he received
their public thanks; and as a mark of their entire satisfaction
with his conduct, they again elected him their representative
in the year 1656. The colonel obtained the reversal
of the forfeiture of his estate, and continued in parliament,
successfully exerting himself in behalf of his friends
and the distressed loyalists.</p>

<p>For several years, nothing remarkable occurred in Colonel
Barclay’s life that deserves our particular consideration;
but in 1663, he was unexpectedly arrested and thrown into
Edinburgh Castle, by an order from Government. As no
crime was alleged against him, he was soon liberated; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
it does not appear that he received any compensation for
the injury. His arrest was the more surprising, as he had
suffered so much in the royal cause, and his principles were
well known to be favourable to the Restoration. It is probable,
indeed, that this event arose from the resentment of
some personal enemy; for malevolence often pursues the
best of men, and those eminent for their virtues are by no
means exempted from its baneful effects.</p>

<p>Colonel Barclay’s military and political career had now
drawn to a close; and his future life was devoted to study,
religious abstraction, the practice of charity, and all the
benevolent and amiable pursuits of the human mind. In
the year 1666, he joined the sect called <i>Quakers</i>, and became
as eminent for piety and zeal, in private life, as he
had before been distinguished for courage and intrepidity
in the field. Religious disputes, however, running high in
the country, his life was checquered by many indignities
and insults. Those who had caressed him, while at the
head of an army, by every flattering mark of respect, now
forgot their benefactor, and cruelly sought to embitter his
days by persecution. But he steadily adhered to his principles;
for it could scarcely be supposed, that a man who
had been bred in the camp of the great Adolphus&mdash;who
had fought for liberty of conscience, and had braved all the
dangers of war&mdash;could be either intimidated, or diverted
from his purpose by the assaults of power, or the threatening
clamour of a senseless rabble.</p>

<p>The colonel now generally resided at Ury, enjoying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
society of his friends, and disseminating among his neighbours
the doctrines of the Quakers. Many of “good account”
embraced their tenets; and weekly and monthly
meetings of these peaceable and religious people were held
at Ury, for devotional exercises. But the clergy looked on
them with an eye of jealousy, and stirred up against them
the malicious passions of weak and intolerant men. And
in the month of March 1676, Colonel Barclay and others,
were indicted at Aberdeen, before a committee of the privy-council,
for holding meetings contrary to a statute enacted
against armed field conventicles, which, under every latitude
of interpretation, could not be applied to Quakers.
They were, however, found guilty, and amerced in a fine
to the amount of a fourth part of their respective valued
rents, and committed to prison until payment should be
made.</p>

<p>The colonel’s son, the celebrated Apologist, was at that
time in London, and having much interest at Court, obtained
his father’s liberation. But the magistrates of Aberdeen
were so enraged that he should thus escape from their power,
that they illegally granted a warrant to distrain his goods,
and sent a Captain Melvill to put it in execution, although,
his residence being in another county, he was evidently
beyond their jurisdiction. Melvill was a low fellow, who
had formerly been a trooper in the colonel’s regiment, and
was therefore personally known to him; but he had acquired
all the insolence of office, and, presuming on the
support of the magistrates, drove off the cattle and horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
at Ury. In June 1677, he was again imprisoned, along
with his son, in the chapel prison of Aberdeen; for the
magistrates pursued him and his friends with no moderate
degree of malignancy. They were, however, relieved by
an order from the Court, in which the magistrates were
severely reprimanded for their oppressive conduct.</p>

<p>On this occasion, a friend of Colonel Barclay’s could not
avoid regretting the difference of times, and contrasting his
present situation, with that when he rescued the city of
Aberdeen from the oppressions of Huntly. But this worthy
man replied, “that, although the magistrates usually came
miles to meet him when he had the command of an army,
and, to gain his favour, conducted him amidst the acclamations
of the people to an entertainment prepared for
him in the town-hall, yet he was more proud, and felt
more real satisfaction, in his sufferings for the cause of
religion and virtue, than in all the fleeting honours with
which they had then distinguished him.”</p>

<p>From this time, Colonel Barclay enjoyed a state of calm
and dignified repose. His latter days were sweetened by
family endearment, and all the charms of a country life.
This brave, sincere, and religious man, died, anno 1686, in
the 77th year of his age, and was buried in a cemetery at
Ury, which he had caused to be constructed for himself and
his posterity. In this humble mausoleum his grave is still
to be seen, and it is distinguished for its length; for he was
one of the tallest, strongest, and most handsome men in the
kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Barclay had five children, viz.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Robert</i>, the Apologist, his heir and successor.</li>
<li><i>Jean</i>, married to Sir Evan Cameron of Locheill.</li>
<li><i>David</i>, who died on his passage to East Jersey.</li>
<li><i>Lucy</i>, who died in April 1687, aged 33.</li>
<li>&mdash;&mdash;, who died in East Jersey, in 1731.</li>
</ul>

<p>(18.) <i>Robert Barclay</i>, generally known by the title of the
<i>Apologist</i>, was born on the 28th of December 1648, at Gordonston
in Morayshire, the seat of his maternal grandfather.
After being educated in the best schools in Scotland, he was
placed under the tuition of his uncle, who was rector of the
Scots College in Paris. He gave early presages of great
genius, and acquired much proficiency in all the learned
sciences and elegant accomplishments of the times. He
soon became conspicuous, and was particularly noticed for
his vivacity and acuteness in the public disputations of the
seminary, where he gained many prizes. His uncle was
extremely solicitous to detain him in France; but his mother,
on her death-bed, had strongly enjoined his removal
from the college, lest he should imbibe the errors of popery.
In obedience to parental authority, he returned home in
1664, and thus lost his uncle’s fortune and favour, to gratify
his father’s conscientious compliance with the prejudiced
but pious notions of his mother. Though destitute of
wealth, he possessed what was more valuable, for his mind
was deeply fraught with the riches of literature.</p>

<p>Soon after his return to Scotland, he joined the society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
called Quakers, and became their greatest ornament and
ablest advocate. Previously, however, to his embracing
the opinions of that sect, he visited his friends of all religious
persuasions, to canvass their doctrines, that he might
adopt a system of faith corresponding to the truths of the
gospel; and, by conviction alone, as we are informed, he
was guided in his choice. But probably, when in France,
he had formed an attachment to the Quietists, who were
the Quakers among Roman Catholics.</p>

<p>In the year 1670, he married <i>Christian Molison</i>, of the
family of <i>Lachintully</i>, the grand-daughter of the celebrated
Colonel Molison, who so much signalized himself in the
defence of Candia against the Turks. About this time, he
first appeared as an author, by a work, entitled, “<i>Truth
cleared of Calumnies</i>,” which is an answer to “<i>A Dialogue
between a Quaker and a Stable Christian</i>,” written by William
Mitchell, a preacher, and printed at Aberdeen. A
keen controversy then subsisted between the clergy of
Aberdeen and the Quakers, relative to the doctrines of the
latter, which, warmly interesting Barclay, called forth his
talents as a polemical writer; and in the same year, he
published a postscript in the form of questions. Mitchell
replied to “<i>Truth cleared of Calumnies</i>,” and our author
again answered him in a work, entitled, “<i>William Mitchell
unmasked</i>,” which was published in 1672. In this controversy,
Robert Barclay discovers the variety of his learning,
and that he was well acquainted with ecclesiastical history;
but above all, he shews with how much judgment and dexterity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
he could apply his knowledge in support of his religious
opinions.</p>

<p>In 1673, he published “<i>A Catechism and Confession of
Faith</i>,” which is an exposition of the doctrines and principles
of the Quakers, supported by an appeal to Scripture
testimony. His next publication is the “<i>Theses Theologicæ</i>,”
which were addressed “to the clergy of what sort
soever,” and contain fifteen propositions, on which he
gives his sentiments, and explains them in conformity to
the principles of his sect. He vindicated his <i>Theses</i> from
the strictures of Nicolas Arnold, professor in the university
of Franquer in Friesland, by a Latin treatise printed at
Amsterdam, in 1675. In the same year, he published an
account of a disputation between the students of divinity of
the university of Aberdeen and the Quakers, in which he
bore a conspicuous part; but, like most religious controversies,
it terminated without satisfaction to either party.
The students also published an account of this conference,
in a pamphlet entitled, “<i>Quakerism canvassed</i>,” which occasioned
a reply, entitled, “<i>Quakerism confirmed</i>,” in two
parts, both printed in 1676.</p>

<p>Previously to this time, he generally resided at Ury with
his father; but in this year he went to London, and thence
to Holland, accompanied by William Penn, the celebrated
and amiable proprietor of the province of Pennsylvania.
These religious men travelled in Holland and Germany,
visiting their friends, and disseminating their doctrines.
They waited upon Elizabeth, princess-palatine of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Rhine, at her residence at Herwerden, and were kindly received.
She seems to have adopted their doctrines, for she
openly patronised the Quakers; but her friendship for Barclay
was sincere and unfeigned, and lasted during life.
She frequently wrote to him with her own hand; and always
promoted his views at the court of England, as far as
her influence could be of service to him or his friends.
When he returned to London, he learned that his father
and other Quakers were imprisoned in Aberdeen, for holding
meetings in that city. He therefore presented a memorial
in their behalf to Charles II. which was delivered
by himself into the king’s own hand, who caused his secretary
of state, the Duke of Lauderdale, to underwrite upon
it a favourable reference to the council of Scotland, which
had the desired effect, as they soon after obtained their
liberty.</p>

<p>In this year, (1676,) he published “<i>The Apology for
True Christian Divinity</i>,” in Latin, at Amsterdam, which is
the most celebrated of his works. It is dedicated to King
Charles II.; and the dedication is remarkable for the freedom
and boldness of sentiment and language in which his
majesty is addressed. “Thou hast tasted,” he says, “of
prosperity and adversity; thou knowest what it is to be
banished thy native country, to be over-ruled as well as
to rule, and sit upon the throne; and, being oppressed,
thou hast reason to know how hateful the oppressor is
both to God and man. If, after all these warnings and
advertisements, thou dost not turn to the Lord with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
thy heart, but forget him who remembered thee in thy
distress, and give up thyself to folly, lust, and vanity&mdash;surely
great will be thy condemnation.”&mdash;The <i>Apology</i>
is reared on the “<i>Theses Theologicæ</i>,” being an exposition
of the fifteen propositions contained in that work. The
author’s general plan is, to state the position he means to
establish, and to support it by Scripture quotations applicable
to the case, or to deduce it by an argument in the
form of a syllogism. By this learned work, he acquired
great celebrity as a deep theologian, profoundly skilled in
the scriptures, the fathers, and church history. His next
publication, which also appeared this year, is entitled,
“<i>The Anarchy of the Ranters</i>,” and it is a vindication of
the society from the imputation of disorderly practices in
their discipline, of which they were accused by their adversaries.</p>

<p>About the end of September, the Apologist returned to
Ury; and although he had obtained his father’s release
from confinement, yet he was not able to protect himself.
On the 7th November 1676, he was committed to prison in
Aberdeen, along with several other Quakers, for holding
meetings for public worship, and did not regain his liberty
until the 9th of April 1677. While in prison, he wrote a
treatise, entitled, “<i>Universal Love considered and established
upon its right foundation</i>,” which was published after his
release.</p>

<p>He left Ury in May, and went to London to exert himself
for the deliverance of the Quakers of the north country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
who were still harassed by imprisonment and fines, for
holding meetings at Aberdeen, in contravention, as it was
alleged, of a statute enacted against “<i>armed field conventicles</i>,”
which evidently did not apply to these peaceable
people. From “<i>Theobalds near London</i>,” he wrote to the
princess-palatine on this subject, in which he gives an account
of a conversation that passed between him and the
Duke of York relative to the sufferings of the Quakers. It
appears by this letter, that he had addressed his royal highness
in very plain language, for he says, “I told him, I understood
from Scotland, that, notwithstanding Lauderdale
was there, and had promised to do something before he
went, yet our friends’ bonds were rather increased, and
that there was only one thing to be done which I desired of
him, and that was to write effectually to the Duke of Lauderdale,
in that style wherein Lauderdale might understand
that he was serious in the business, and did really intend
the thing he did write concerning should take effect;
which I knew he might do, and I supposed the other might
answer; which, if he would do, I must acknowledge as a
great kindness. But if he did write, and not in that manner,
so that the other might not suppose him to be serious,
I would rather he would excuse himself the trouble:&mdash;desiring
withal, to excuse my plain manner of dealing, as
being different from the court way of soliciting: all which
he seemed to take in good part, and said he would write as
I desired.”&mdash;He soon after returned to Ury, and was permitted
to enjoy the full exercise of his religion unmolested,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
until the 9th of November 1679, when he was taken out of
a meeting at Aberdeen, as well as several of his friends
but they were discharged in a few hours, and never after
wards disturbed by the magistrate.</p>

<p>The “<i>Apology</i>,” which had become widely circulated in
six different languages, was rudely assailed by John Brown,
in a work, entitled, “<i>Quakerism the path-way to Paganism</i>.”
To this abusive performance, Barclay replied in vindication
of his doctrines; which is the last of his polemical writings
that are published. From this period, he was occupied,
for the most part, in travelling in England, relative to the
concerns of the society; and, when in London in 1682, he
was honoured with a public appointment, having received
a commission as governor of East Jersey in America. An
extensive tract of land in that province, was, at the same
time, granted to him and his heirs in fee. Charles II. confirmed
his government for life; and the commission is expressed
in terms highly flattering to this good man:&mdash;“Such
are his known fidelity and capacity,” it says, “that
he has the government during life; but that every governor
after him shall have it for three years only.” He
was authorised to appoint a deputy-governor, with a salary
of L 400 sterling per annum; and Gavin Laurie, a merchant
in London, was accordingly appointed to that office.
Having arranged these matters, he returned to Ury; but
in summer 1683, he again visited his friends in London.
Towards the close of that year, however, he came home
and occupied himself in shipping stores, provisions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
other necessaries, from Aberdeen, to the colony of East
Jersey, in the prosperity of which he was extremely interested.</p>

<p>In 1685, he went again to London relative to the concerns
of the society; but soon returned, and remained at
home till April 1687, when, at the earnest solicitation of
George Fox and other friends, he set off for court, to exert
his influence on behalf of the Quakers. As the king honoured
him with his friendship, he had access to his majesty
at all times; and on this occasion, he presented an
address from the Quakers in Scotland, expressive of their
gratitude for his majesty’s proclamation, permitting liberty
of conscience, which was graciously received. The Apologist
seems to have stood on a footing of great intimacy
with the king, and to have conversed with him candidly
and freely on the business of the state. Considering the
intricacy of his majesty’s affairs at that time, the opinion or
advice of a sincere and honest, yet clear-headed man, was,
no doubt, highly valued by James. Having accomplished
the object of his journey, he returned home.</p>

<p>In November 1688, he was again in London, and embraced
that opportunity to take leave of his majesty, with
whose misfortunes he was greatly affected. At his last interview
with the king, (while they were standing at a window
in the palace conversing together,) James looked out
and said, “The wind is fair to bring over the Prince of
Orange;” the Apologist remarked, “It was hard that no
expedient could be fallen upon to satisfy the people.” His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
majesty replied, “He would do any thing becoming a
gentleman, but never would part with his liberty of conscience.”
This sentiment, being so consonant to the Apologist’s
mind, and corresponding so closely with his own
principles and practice, drew forth his approbation; and
with mutual regret they parted, to meet no more.</p>

<p>In the month of December he arrived at Ury, and lived
retired for nearly two years, enjoying domestic happiness
in the bosom of his family. But having gone to Aberdeen
about the end of September 1690, to attend a meeting of
Quakers, he caught cold while returning home, and, being
seized with a fever, it put a period to his life on the 3d of
October, after a short but severe illness.</p>

<p>With a mind naturally strong and vigorous, he possessed
all the advantages of a regular and classical education; and
his writings evidently shew the profundity of his research,
as well as the extent and variety of his learning. His mild
temper, benevolent heart, and sprightly conversation, gave
him influence with men in elevated stations, which he employed
not for the benefit of his friends alone. From motives
of pure benevolence, he often successfully exerted himself
in behalf of others, as well as for the members of the
society to which he belonged. If, on one occasion, he inconsiderately
betrayed a fervour of zeal in his profession of
a preacher, by exposing himself in sackcloth on the streets
of Aberdeen in the year 1672, we must concede to him, at
least, the merit of sincerity, and, in justice, make every
allowance for the ardour of a youthful mind. Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
his feelings were warm, yet his passions were subdued by
strict discipline; and the practical observance of the rules
of moral duty, strengthened and invigorated every virtuous
sentiment. Cheerful, yet serene, he withstood the shocks
of adversity with fortitude and firmness. Ever active and
indefatigable, he composed one of his best works within the
walls of a prison; and, in all situations, he was constantly
occupied with what he conceived to be for the good of
mankind. Considering the shortness of his life, and the
time he employed in travelling, it is astonishing that he
could write so much and so well. But his works have outlived
him; and, in three volumes, the scattered opinions of
the society to which he belonged, are collected, arranged,
and exhibited to the whole world in elegant uniformity;
and throughout Europe and America, “<i>The Apology for
True Christian Divinity</i>,” is to be found in the libraries of
the wise and the learned<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Apologist had nine children, and was succeeded by
his second son, <i>Robert</i>; the first son, <i>David</i>, having died
on a voyage to East Jersey, at the age of fifteen. After
the family of Ury had embraced the tenets of the amiable
society of <span class="smcap">Friends</span>, it is not to be expected that it could
make any conspicuous figure in the transactions of the
times. The pursuits of the Quakers being solely directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
to objects of benevolence, they are precluded by both principle
and practice, from interfering in civil or military contests.
During the turbulent periods of 1715 and 45, the
Barclays, therefore, took no concern in public affairs, but
remained silent spectators of the passing events.</p>

<p>The Apologist’s son, <i>Robert</i>, had seven children, and died
anno 1747. He was a man of such polite manners, that he
obtained the appellation of the <i>Gentleman</i>, and was distinguished
among his cotemporaries by his good sense and
affability. He was succeeded by his eldest son,</p>

<p><i>Robert</i>, who had three sons and one daughter. The
grandson of the Apologist was known in the county by the
title of the <i>Strong</i>, having possessed great muscular power.
He died in the year 1760, and was deemed the richest
commoner in the county of Kincardine, having left a free
estate and a considerable sum of money to his family. He
was succeeded by his eldest son, <i>Robert</i>, the father of Capt.
Barclay.</p>

<p>From these three families a numerous race has sprung,
and the descendants of the Apologist, at the present time,
exceed three hundred. The late Mr. David Barclay of
Walthamstow in Essex, (the grandson of the Apologist,)
says, “I believe there are more than three hundred of you
who call me uncle or cousin.” Those respectable families
which claim their descent from the Apologist, are principally
settled in England; and, while they have enriched
themselves by their industry, they maintain the highest
respectability of character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>It does not, however, suit our object to follow the family
of Ury through all its branches: it is enough that we take
notice of the heir of succession; and the late Mr. Barclay
deserves to be particularly mentioned, on account of his
great celebrity as an agriculturist.</p>

<p>He was born anno 1731, and succeeded his father, 1760.
He received a liberal education, and was an excellent
Greek and Latin scholar. He was a noted pedestrian, and
frequently walked to London. On one occasion, he walked
from London to Ury, (510 miles,) in ten successive days;
on another, he walked 210 miles in three days, or at the
rate of 70 miles a day. He also went 81 miles in about
16 hours. He never walked to London after he was elected
a member of parliament, as erroneously reported; but he
had frequently done so before that time. His ordinary
pace was six miles an hour. His height was six feet. He
was athletic, and of the handsomest form. The vigour of
his mind was conspicuous throughout a laborious and active
life; and his improvements in agriculture, entitle him
to the warmest eulogy of his countrymen.</p>

<p>Mr. Robertson, the intelligent author of the ‘Survey of
Kincardineshire,’ has devoted 27 pages of his work to illustrate
Mr. Barclay’s agricultural improvements; and, from
his account, as there can be no better testimony, we shall
extract the following particulars.</p>

<p>‘The man,’ says Mr. Robertson, ‘who exerted himself
most for the improvement of the county&mdash;whose labours
were the most strenuous and best conducted&mdash;and whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
example had the most extensive influence&mdash;was the late
Mr. Barclay of Ury. His, indeed, were no common powers.
Endowed with the most ardent, energetic, and comprehensive
mind, he employed his great talents as an agriculturist
with unwearied perseverance, and to the most beneficial
results. The subject he had to improve, or rather
to subdue, was of the most obdurate nature; but difficulties
tended only to excite his activity, and, adhering tenaciously
to his own pre-conceived and well-adjusted plans,
he was ultimately successful.</p>

<p>‘The estate of Ury, the chief object of his improvements,
lies on both sides of the rivulet of Cowie, and extends from
Stonehaven in a north-westerly direction, for nearly five
miles. The mansion-house is situated about a mile and a
half from the efflux of the Cowie, on its northern bank.&mdash;When
Mr. Barclay succeeded to the estate, there was
scarcely a shrub of any value on the whole property, excepting
a few old trees around the house.</p>

<p>‘The arable land was divided into a number of small
farms. The tillage was superficially performed, with very
imperfect implements. Almost every field was incumbered
with obstructions of one kind or another; such as, pools of
stagnant water or quagmires, where the cattle were ever in
danger of losing their lives; great baulks of unploughed
land between the ridges; but, above all, stones abounded,
not only on the surface, but through the whole depth of
the soil. There were no inclosures. No lime was used as
a manure and the only crops were bear and oats. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
was neither cart nor wheel carriage of any kind; nor was
there even a road. In short, no place, at that time, abounded
more in the evils attending the ancient system, or enjoyed
fewer of the advantages of modern husbandry than
the lands of Ury.’</p>

<p>Mr. Barclay, who had acquired his ideas of agriculture
on the fertile plains of Norfolk, could ill brook a state of
husbandry like this. As soon, therefore, as he succeeded
to the estate, he set about its improvement in a stile that
was both radical and permanent. To accomplish this object,
he took under his own management all the farms in
the vicinity of the mansion-house, as the leases expired;
besides retaining those lands which had always been in the
natural possession of the family. In the course of thirty
years, he thoroughly improved 2000 acres of arable land,
and planted about 1500 acres of wood. Of the arable
land, there were 800 acres originally marsh or heath. Of
the remainder, which was let to tenants, about one-fourth
part consisted of baulks, wastes, and marshes, interspersed
through every field. Mr. Barclay thus meliorated about
2000 acres, and brought them to a correct state of culture,
and they are now in a high degree of fertility.</p>

<p>The laborious measures by which Mr. Barclay improved
the estate of Ury, are particularly detailed in the valuable
work previously mentioned; but it would carry us beyond
our limits to enter minutely into them: and perhaps it may
suffice to say, that, from a rugged and barren surface, he
produced the most beautiful place in North Britain. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
was considered the father of agriculture in the north of
Scotland: His example has been everywhere imitated;
and his memory is held dear by all the lovers of this first
and most important <i>art</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Barclay represented the county of Kincardine in
three parliaments, having been unanimously elected; which
is highly creditable to his talents and his virtues. He was
the intimate friend of William Pitt, and always distinguished
himself by his loyalty, and attachment to the best interests
of his country.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to add to this account, that, while
Capt. Barclay is descended from respectable ancestors of
the ancient family of Barclay, he has an undoubted right,
by the mother’s side, to the title of Earl of Monteith and
Airth, being the representative of Lady Mary Graham, the
eldest daughter of the last Earl of Monteith and Airth, who
was descended of David, Earl of Strathern, the eldest son
of Robert II. by his queen, Euphemia Ross.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> A learned antiquary has obligingly communicated to
the author the following etymon of the name <i>Barclay</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Barclay</i> is a compound word, and pure Gaelic. <i>Bar</i>
is borrowed from the Gaelic, and adopted into the English
language. In both, the signification is the same, i. e. the
bar or bolt of a door, gate, &amp;c. <i>Clay</i> is the Gaelic <i>Cladh</i>,
pronounced <i>clay</i>, and signifying a sword. Every one
knows that <i>Cladh Mor</i>, pronounced <i>Claymore</i>, signifies the
<i>great</i> or <i>broad</i> sword. As <i>C</i> and <i>G</i> are commutable letters
in the Gaelic, it is generally written <i>Cladh</i>, though, sometimes
<i>Gladh</i>. <i>Gladh</i> is the radix of the Latin <i>Gladius</i>;
and <i>Cladh</i>, perhaps, of the Latin <i>Clades</i>. The name <i>Barclay</i>,
then, literally imports, ‘<i>The Bar Sword</i>,’ or ‘<i>Sword
of Defence</i>.’</p>

<p>“Previous to the use of gunpowder, when every thing
depended on personal strength and individual exertion,
the single arm of a hero often decided the fate of the battle.
Many of our ancient families derived their names
from feats of prowess; and there is no doubt that the Barclays
received their name from some singular act of heroism
performed with the sword.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Mr. Molyson has often walked thirty-six miles to
breakfast, and thirty farther to dinner. He attended Capt.
Barclay when he went to Dr. Grant’s house at Kirkmichael,
in August 1800, (<i>see page 108</i>); and in less than three
days walked one hundred and eighty miles, without sleeping
during that time. Mr. Molyson was then forty-eight
years of age; but his athletic powers are astonishing, and
he is a true lover of gymnastic sports.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
